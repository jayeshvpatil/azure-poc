"1","Are intrusive thoughts harmful?","Intrusive thoughts are generally not considered harmful. According to Dr. Robert Chester, a clinical psychologist, while intrusive thoughts can be unsettling, they are not always a sign of mental illness or an indication of a hidden desire to act on those thoughts. Research has shown that people who experience intrusive thoughts are not more likely to act upon them [doc1]. 

In summary, although intrusive thoughts can be disturbing, they are not inherently harmful and are often a common experience among individuals [doc1].","{""citations"":[{""content"":""Title: uh_blogs.csvry-psychology'}, {'label': 'primary care physicians', 'url': '/services/primary-care'}, {'label': 'behavioral health professionals', 'url': '/services/behavioral-health'}]\t\n\n Has an unsettling thought or a disturbing image ever popped into your head, seemingly from out of nowhere? If you answered yes, you are one of six million Americans who have experienced intrusive thoughts.\n \n\nWhat Are Intrusive Thoughts?\n----------------------------\n\n Intrusive thoughts are unwanted ideas and images that come to mind unexpectedly. These thoughts can be directed towards yourself, your loved ones or people who just happen to be nearby at the moment.\n \n\n Some common examples include:\n \n\n* A parent thinking about hurting their baby or child.\n* A fleeting urge to jump when standing on a bridge or rooftop of a tall building (a phenomenon also known as “the call of the void” or “the high place phenomenon”).\n* Thoughts of running your car off the road or swerving into oncoming traffic.\n* Thoughts about doing something embarrassing; for example, shouting obscenities or doing something inappropriate in public.\n\nAre Intrusive Thoughts Harmful?\n-------------------------------\n\n “The short answer is no,” says Robert Chester, PsyD , a clinical psychologist with University Hospitals Department of Psychiatry. “Although intrusive thoughts can be unsettling, they are not always a sign of mental illness or an indication that you have a hidden desire to follow through with the disturbing or strange thought that arose in your mind.”\n \n\n What’s more, multiple studies have shown that people who have intrusive thoughts are not more likely to act on them.\n \n\nWhat Causes Intrusive Thoughts?\n-------------------------------\n\n Stress is the most common trigger for intrusive thoughts. But even people with normal or low stress levels can experience the occasional intrusive thought. Most intrusive thoughts fall into one of the following categories, which can feel understandably disturbing:\n \n\n* A phobia or deep-seated fear\n* Embarrassing or shameful\n* Immoral or against your values\n* Violent or sexual in nature\n\n So, what prompts a healthy brain to produce ideas that are disturbing – or even at odds with – who you are? Some researchers believe intrusive thoughts are a type of misinterpreted warning signal, a sort of brain hiccup.\n \n\n “Intrusive thoughts may serve to protect us from our deepest fears or potential dangers,” says Dr. Chester. “For example, the sudden urge to step off a bridge causes you to step back. Similarly, the mother who has an intrusive thought about hurting her baby nearly always reacts with feelings of horror because her baby’s well-being is all that matters. Ultimately, intrusive thoughts remind us of the things we value the most in our lives.”\n \n\nHow to Stop Intrusive Thoughts\n------------------------------\n\n Here are some tips to help manage intrusive thoughts:\n \n\n* **Identify and recognize the intrusive thought** \n . A thought may be intrusive if:\n+ It’s very different from your usual thoughts.\n+ It’s disturbing and bothersome to you, and you want to rid your mind of it.\n+ The thought feels difficult to control – intrusive thoughts are typically repetitive and often get “stuck in your head.”\n\n* **Don’t fight it.** \n When you have an intrusive thought, try to accept it. As unsettling as they may feel, intrusive thoughts usually go away if you accept them without focusing on them or trying to push them away.\n* **Don’t judge yourself** \n . Remind yourself that having this type of unusual or alarming thought does not mean that something is wrong with you. Thoughts are not the same as behavior.\n\nWhen to Seek Help\n-----------------\n\n You should seek the help of a mental health professional if your intrusive thoughts are disruptive to your daily life, especially if they interfere with your ability to work or to do things you enjoy. A therapist can help determine if intrusive thoughts are a symptom of a mental health condition, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), generalized anxiety disorder, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n \n\n Many people learn to manage intrusive thoughts with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), which helps patients change thought patterns. In addition, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and certain other antidepressant medications can be effective in managing intrusive thoughts.\n \n\n “Psychologists are here to help, not judge,” adds Dr. Chester.  “Please do not be ashamed to share your intrusive thoughts with us. We’ve heard it all.”\n \n\n**Related Links** \n\n Signs and symptoms of mental illness should not be ignored. University Hospitals has a wide network of primary care physicians and behavioral health professionals at convenient locations across the region who can diagnose and treat all types of depression, anxiety and other mental health disorders.\n \n\n\thttps://www.uhhospitals.org/blog/articles/2024/02/why-do-people-have-intrusive-thoughts\n\tBreathe Your Way to Better Health &amp; Less Stress\tFebruary 06, 2024\t[{'label': 'Deep Breathing', 'url': '/blog/tags/deep-breathing"",""title"":"""",""url"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""filepath"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""chunk_id"":""0""},{""content"":""Title: uh_blogs.csv, crowds. What about anxieties that are harder to explain, emotional anxieties that may not manifest themselves in everyday actions that you’re avoiding? Does that make sense?\n \n\n**Dr. Robert Chester** \n  \n\n I would want to clarify first, too, that we want to make sure that we understand it’s not the situation that’s causing us anxiety, which seems counterintuitive, but it’s what we’re telling ourselves about the situation. So, that’s why like I’m able to go in a crowd and I’m fine, but someone else might have an issue, because I don’t tell myself the things that they tell themselves. That’s a big part of it, but something like, you know, just worrying generally about the future, that can be tough, because you feel like you should, and there’s a part of you that really should like productively think about the future, cause then you can make plans for it. But if you get to the point where you’re like predicting that, you know, you’re going to lose your job or you’re going to, your wife’s going to leave you or something like that, if you don’t have any evidence for that, then you’re just making yourself miserable for no reason. But you got to be able to pay attention to your thoughts in order to get to that point in the first place.\n \n\n**Pete Kenworthy** \n  \n\n But paying attention to those thoughts, doesn’t make it go away.\n \n\n**Dr. Robert Chester** \n  \n\n No.\n \n\n**Pete Kenworthy** \n  \n\n Right?\n \n\n**Dr. Robert Chester** \n  \n\n Right. Yeah. So, the first step is making sure not only paying attention, but seeing if they fit into those different categories of cognitive distortions like I talked about earlier. Once you figure that out, then it’s the challenging of the thoughts time, which you can do on your own. You don’t need me, but I can help guide people through that process on how to do it. And it could be nice, you know, hearing another person’s perspective, especially, you know, someone who doesn’t have, you know, an emotional investment in the person or their, I mean, I can have some of that as a therapist, but I’m not living with them every day. You know, there’s a big difference there. If you are, that can be really hard to cope with someone who has a lot of anxiety, because you know it’s irrational, they know it’s irrational, but they can’t stop themselves from doing it.\n \n\n So, this is why people say, oh, just stop worrying. I mean, if that worked, I wouldn’t have a job. So, that doesn’t work. It just makes people worry more and get angry at you for it. So, there are times when it would be beneficial to see someone like me who can guide you that process and how to challenge these thoughts. But it starts with looking for evidence. And when I say evidence, I mean it more in the legal sense, really, like what is some evidence that would convince a jury that your thought’s accurate or correct? Not, you know, it just feels right. You need something more like, well, this has happened to me before or something like that. That doesn’t necessarily mean it’s going to happen again, but that can be some evidence that it could happen at least. And that evidence against, of course, you know. What are some of the reasons why this is unlikely to happen? I try to get people away from thinking about possibilities and thinking more about probabilities, which is a big deal, cause anything is possible. And if we worry about that, then we’re really going to be stuck. But if we can think about, well, what’s likely, or what’s probable to happen? Everything in life carries risks. So, we need to always be weighing that pretty much.\n \n\n**Pete Kenworthy** \n  \n\n You talk about how it might be beneficial for some people to come talk to someone like you. How do we know when it’s that time? Right? That’s kind of the key here. Right? Lots of people worry. Lots of people, everybody has anxiety. Right? But not everybody needs to come talk to you. If we’re living with someone who we think maybe borderline disorder or maybe has a disorder or we’re that person ourselves, how do we know? How do we know when it hits that point to come talk to you or to talk to someone about medication or any of those kinds of measures?\n \n\n**Dr. Robert Chester** \n  \n\n I think when it starts to affect your functioning in a negative way. So, if you’re avoiding a lot of things and that’s starting to impact, you know, your grades in school, cause you’re missing classes all the time, that would be a great indication to come see someone like me, cause you’re stuck now in that kind"",""title"":"""",""url"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""filepath"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""chunk_id"":""0""},{""content"":""Title: uh_blogs.csv PsyD', 'url': '/doctors/Ahmed-Samina-1104256916'}, {'label': 'Carolyn Landis, PhD', 'url': '/doctors/IeversLandis-Carolyn-1376564732'}, {'label': 'Learn more', 'url': '/rainbow/services/sleep-medicine'}, {'label': 'Learn more.', 'url': '/services/pulmonary-and-sleep-services/conditions-and-treatments/sleep-disorders'}]\t\n\n If you use sleeping aids – whether prescription or non-prescription – you've likely heard or read that this is not an ideal long-term solution for insomnia . Nevertheless, some 10 million Americans use prescription medicines, and millions more rely on over-the-counter remedies.\n \n\n If you have had insomnia for a long time, it might be frightening to contemplate going off those medicines. There is another solution that studies have shown to be effective – Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), provided through four to six sessions with a trained therapist.\n \n\n First, though, you likely have insomnia if you experience:\n \n\n* Struggling to fall asleep, taking longer than 20 minutes at least three times a week to do so.\n* Waking up frequently through the night and struggling to return to sleep.\n* Waking up often before your alarm and feeling unrefreshed.\n* Your sleep difficulties affecting your ability to perform your best at work or to complete daily tasks.\n\n If you have acute insomnia that has recently occurred because of life stressors, a physician might prescribe a temporary prescription of hypnotic medication or other sleep aids. But for chronic insomnia (more than three months of continued sleep difficulties), CBT-I is at least as effective as medication in the short-term and more effective in the long-term.\n \n\n CBT-I is based on scientific knowledge of sleep. The cognitive part focuses on your thoughts, feelings and expectations about sleep and insomnia, all of which may affect how well you sleep. The behavioral part of CBT-I helps you develop proven sleep habits and reduce problematic behaviors contributing to insomnia. We talked with Samina Ahmed, PsyD , a UH clinical psychologist with specialized training in CBT-I treatment for adults, to learn more about this therapy.\n \n\nQ. We've all heard a lot about the importance of sleep hygiene. Is that what CBT is about?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n A. No, it's much more. Sleep hygiene, in which you adopt habits such as going to bed at the same time each day, keeping your bedroom cool and quiet, and not using electronic devices for a few hours before sleep, is not enough to treat insomnia. But it's a good place to start. I spend perhaps 10 minutes in the first session talking about sleep hygiene. The rest of the time is spent learning about the patient's current sleep behaviors, how the patient is addressing the sleep problems and any stress or life changes that might be contributing to poor sleep. The session concludes with an introduction to CBT-I and the importance of tracking their sleep patterns on a sleep log so I can adapt the treatment to the individual needs of each patient.\n \n\nQ. What happens at later sessions?\n----------------------------------\n\n A. After that, each session starts with a review of sleep log data to see what recommendations helped and what continues to be problematic. I typically start with making behavioral changes around sleep, and then cognitive changes – such as challenging negative thoughts around sleep and fear about what will happen if you don't get enough sleep. Cognitive restructuring may sound difficult to practice but is an important component of treatment. Treatment concludes with relapse prevention; the idea is to provide patients with a toolkit of what they can do to address insomnia should it come back.\n \n\nQ. What is wrong with taking a prescription medicine such as Ambien (zolpidem tartrate) to fall asleep?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n A. This is largely dependent on individual cases but overall, hypnotics were created to be taken on a short-term basis. Long-term use of Ambien might promote sleep, but is likely suppressing deep sleep or REM sleep. With time, the medication might lose its effectiveness and you might find yourself needing a higher dose to achieve the same effect. When you get older, there is also a greater fall risk due to side effects of the medication.\n \n\nQ. Some people takes benzodiazepines to help them sleep. Is that worrisome?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n A. Yes, those can be highly addictive and foster a dependence on the medication. Benzodiazepines also are likely to lead to daytime grogginess and present with some of the same concerns as long-term hypnotic use. With that said, it is important to manage anxiety to promote sleep. I find patients function better with daytime use of benzodiazepines or other anxiolytics with emphasis on relaxation at bedtime.\n \n\nQ. Does anxiety about falling asleep affect the ability to fall asleep?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n A. Absolutely, the greater the pressure to fall asleep the harder it is to go to sleep"",""title"":"""",""url"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""filepath"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""chunk_id"":""0""},{""content"":""Title: uh_blogs.csv.pandora.com/podcast/the-science-of-health-podcast/PC:50484/'}, {'label': 'Spotify', 'url': 'https://open.spotify.com/show/41zIrk1mwWSQnawaAjVzmX'}, {'label': 'Patrick Runnels, MD', 'url': '/doctors/Runnels-Patrick-1558374645'}, {'label': 'Dr. Patrick Runnels', 'url': '/doctors/Runnels-Patrick-1558374645'}, {'label': '*A World Without Email*', 'url': 'https://www.calnewport.com/books/a-world-without-email/'}]\t\n\n**Subscribe:** Apple Podcasts \\| YouTube Podcasts \\| Pandora \\| Spotify *Text messages, emails, news notifications and social media have us in a heightened state of stimulation.

Being in the moment decreases anxiety and stress and allows us to be happier overall.* \n\n---\n\n**Macie Jepson** \n  \n\n So, Pete, when was the last time you were totally alone with your thoughts? I’m talking no telephone, not even the TV in the background, just you and your brain.\n \n\n**Pete Kenworthy** \n  \n\n Yeah, it’s a hard one, right? I have a hard time with that, actually. I honestly can’t think of a time when it’s just my brain and me. I almost always have my phone nearby or something on the TV. When I’m driving, I have music on. So really, I’m never alone with my thoughts. The only time is maybe when I’m sleeping, right?\n \n\n**Macie Jepson** \n  \n\n Yeah. Same, same. You know, when I do have downtime, I catch up on stuff; my texts, what’s happening in the world. When I’m cooking, I listen to music in the background. Really, the only time that I am completely alone with my thoughts is when I meditate, and by the way, I’m really bad at it. So, what are we missing when we don’t spend time with ourselves? And I’ve often asked myself, are there any benefits to being bored? Hi everybody, I’m Macie Jepson.\n \n\n**Pete Kenworthy** \n  \n\n And I’m Pete Kenworthy. This is\n *Healthy@UH* \n . Our brains today are wired for stimulation, and it’s hard for most of us to turn off the noise. So, are our brains and emotions suffering from the lack of one-on-one time with ourselves? Joining us today is Dr. Patrick Runnels , Chief Medical Officer of Population Health and Vice Chair of the Department of Psychiatry at University Hospitals, Cleveland Medical Center. Thanks for joining us.\n \n\n**Dr. Patrick Runnels** \n  \n\n Great to be here. Thanks for having me.\n \n\n**Pete Kenworthy** \n  \n\n So, let’s start with being overly connected. Is it unhealthy?\n \n\n**Dr. Patrick Runnels** \n  \n\n When you talk about being overly connected, there are two ways in which that can be tough on your brain. Part of that is the amount of information you’re getting and how it’s affecting you emotionally. And part of that is just the act of being connected and not being able to kind of turn off your brain or turn off the connection or really be alone with your thoughts. To start that first piece, when we think about everyone who’s been so connected, especially the last two years, but this has been the trend, what we know is that there is a lot of emotion that starts to get tied to the idea of having a whole lot of information coming at us. So, think about being on a Facebook page or on a Twitter feed, and you’re constantly getting bombarded with these very intense messages. And intensity can be defined a lot of ways.\n \n\n If I’m on Twitter, one form of intensity, for instance, right now would be seeing a lot of tweets about the Ukrainian War. And the Ukrainian War might be really stressful. You know, for a lot of people, it\n *is* \n really stressful. It’s a very stressful, big, big deal. And if I’m constantly getting input every second, every few seconds new tweets coming on about that, then I’m going to start to exhort that anxiety. It’s like kind of rapidly throwing something in your face all the time. The same thing goes though for just the idea of having a lot of back and forth around any information, right? So, as I have more and more information coming at me and I’m trying to, you know, I’m trying to kind of absorb one piece of information. The second piece of information comes at me. And it"",""title"":"""",""url"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""filepath"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""chunk_id"":""0""},{""content"":""Title: uh_blogs.csv at.\n \n\n And one of the phenomena, just to give an example of that, that I hear all the time in the patients I see, is people coming in and saying, I can’t sleep well at night. And I ask them what their sleep is like. And they’ll say some version of, well, I get in bed and I fall asleep and then I wake up and I got to check my phone and I got to look at my emails or I got to see if someone texted or I got to see some version of what’s going on in the news. I can’t get the news off my mind. The New York Times, it updates every 30 seconds with new bombs or new, you know, political mud-slinging, all that stuff I got to kind of check into. And so, it gets to the point where I can’t even just let my, let it all down and just be. And that takes a toll on our mental health.\n \n\n**Macie Jepson** \n  \n\n I want us to talk a little, little bit more about technology and social media in a couple of minutes, but let’s talk about the benefits of actually shutting down our brain, the benefits of boredom.\n \n\n**Dr. Patrick Runnels** \n  \n\n Couple of things to know. When we are, you know, our brains are naturally, there’s thoughts in there, and those thoughts are, it’s natural for brain to have kind of thoughts, pinging, making connections every time we have a stimulus coming in. So, I look at the floor and I see that it’s wood, or I look at the wall and see that it’s white or I see that a person’s coming in. All those stimuli trigger thoughts, and our brains are looking and like to be occupied with things. So, our brains have ways of working. Every human is a little different, but any, as we kind of move through the day, our brains are kind of naturally seeking things to pay attention to. That’s kind of how we evolved. And so, we’re naturally attracted to things that are of interest to us.\n \n\n We like seeing movies or playing video games or reading books that are of topics we like. We like hanging out with certain people more than other people, because they’re compelling to us. They trigger certain kind of emotional thoughts in us. They, you know, our emotions in us, they trigger certain thoughts. And so, in that regard, our brains are looking for stimulus that makes us happy, and that connects with us, and that’s actually, to some degree, somewhat relaxing for us. Someone can be really interested in a topic and look really turned like, turned on, like activated and kind of seem like they’re not relaxed, but be in a state of relative calm because it’s stimulating the brain in a certain way. Take that away, get to a place where you don’t have things that are really be stimulating for you. That is a world that, we kind of call that boredom. And to some degree, if we’re sitting too long without something that’s very stimulating for us, boredom is really the feeling, the discomfort because your attention isn’t being captured in a certain way.\n \n\n So, no matter where I am, I’m still getting stimuli. I’m still being able to see this is a floor that’s wood, and I’m able to see a wall that’s white, but if it’s not capturing my attention in a certain way then I feel uncomfortable. I don’t like it. It’s an unpleasant thing, so boredom serves a purpose. Boredom serves the purpose of having us go seek things out. It also serves the purpose of allowing our brain to start to make new connections. So, if I’m not being fed things all the time that are stimulating to me, well, then my brain’s got to come up with new things to kind of make connections that get us back to that state. That ability to do that is actually where we have a lot of innovation happen, and it’s where a lot of our creativity happens. So, creativity is very heavily correlated with downtime, time when you’re not being over stimulated. In a connected world, when you don’t set that time aside, you lose the opportunity to make creative connections. You lose the opportunity to see things and connect things in a new way. And when that happens, when you miss that all the time, this other thing happens, which is that you start to feel a little bit…despair is the wrong word…but you start to feel a certain sense of unease. It’s not boredom. So, I’m still being stimulated. So, imagine someone who’s checking Facebook all the time and playing video games all the time and constantly checking the news. There’s things going on. They’re usually checking things that are of interest to them, but there starts to be a certain emptiness to it, a certain blaséness\n *(sic)* \n"",""title"":"""",""url"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""filepath"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""chunk_id"":""0""}]}","5","

Doesn’t mean it’s the best way to watch it, but we can. We’re still getting used to that. And you’re seeing a very early part of this where we’re trying to figure out what the right way to use this in our lives as humanity. As a civilization.\n \n\n So, in one sense, something I tell everybody about this is, it’s okay that we’re not getting it quite right. It’s okay if we are going through the pangs of how do we raise our kids? What’s the right way to do it? How much do we, you know, we’re how many debate, how many people listen to this podcast? You know, if you guys have had the, have ever heard the debate with parents of other kids about, do we get them an iPhone? Or do we not get them an iPhone? Do we allow them to have a Facebook account, or we not allow them to have a Facebook account? If I get them their Facebook account, this risk is there, but if I don’t get them, this risk is there. If we, you know and you know, a lot of parents in my circle said, well, if our kids have something like a smartphone, they can text us, and then I don’t have to worry about when to pick them up. They’ll text me, and then I’ll go pick them up. And that’s valuable for me. All of which is to say is there’s pluses and minuses.\n \n\n I say to people less than get worried, I say, you know, what I’d say is a little bit more. We ought to be observing and watching our kids and being very interested in our kids and this generation that’s being raised right now being happy and being fulfilled and being able to go out in the world and feel good about they are interacting with the world. And we know right now it’s all over the place. We know from the news…I’m sure that everybody’s seen this…that things like Instagram when you’re checking all time and you’re a girl, you have a much lower self-esteem about your body. This is a thing that, you know, has come out. And these kinds of things are a big deal. We need to know about this. But we don’t know the nature of how we want to use something like Instagram, or we want to use something like Facebook, or we want to even use something like email and how to help people interact. We’re learning. And so, we want to be a parent. We want to stay attuned to things that are clearly negative on the health. And we make sure our kids are able to enjoy themselves and have fulfilling lives and have social relationships.\n \n\n How that looks is unclear. We don’t have answers to that. We’re just, we’re new at this. And so, we do definitely know, for instance, when kids are depressed. We know when kids have anxiety disorders and we know, and we can connect those deeply, obviously, to certain types of usage of the stuff. So, when someone has a body image issue that leads to depression, and I get them into therapy, we can very quickly make that connection. And there’s actually a whole host of studies that are out there that talk about things like mental health issues as a result of certain types of social media use. But that’s different than just using different types of communication and having a lot of stimulus.\n \n\n And we also know that kids’ intelligence levels aren’t going anywhere. Kids are still plenty smart. It’s not like everyone got dumber. We know that in an individual moment, my IQ drops if I’m, if I’m overstimulated. So, if I have too much communication, and I have you take an IQ test, you’ll do worse. But over the long run, we don’t have any evidence yet that that persists for the rest of your life. We don’t know. I’m sure there are studies on that. But it’s awfully young to know for sure. The whole point of all this is we probably ought to be thinking about this in terms of our values and what we want for our kids. And if we focus on that, and we focus on what are the things we want our kids to get out of life, how do we ensure that they’re happy? Then we approach it less about you should just not be on that, or you should totally be on that. Or you should, you know, and more towards, are they fulfilled? Are they hitting certain milestones? Are they able to communicate? Are they able to have a conversation? You know, if those things are there, then it’s probably less important as to whether or not they had 30 or 60 minutes of time on the internet.\n \n\n**Macie Jepson** \n  \n\n Very good point.\n \n\n**Pete Kenworthy**"",""title"":"""",""url"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""filepath"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""chunk_id"":""0""},{""content"":""Title: uh_blogs.csvalance'}]\t\n\n If you’re dealing with hearing loss, you'll soon be able to buy a hearing aid directly from stores or online, without a prescription or doctor exam. How do you find a hearing aid that’s right for you?\n \n\n Some of it depends on the severity of hearing loss and individual circumstances, says Robin Piper, AuD, CCC-A , audiologist and clinical supervisor of University Hospitals Audiology Services.\n \n\nOver-the Counter Hearing Aids\n------------------------------\n\n The Food and Drug Administration recently authorized over-the-counter hearing aids to make hearing aids more accessible and affordable. They should be available online and in stores as early as mid-October 2022.\n \n\n Only one in four adults who could benefit from hearing aids has used them, according to the National Institutes of Health. Untreated hearing loss can lead to depression, dementia and other problems. Many people also face barriers to getting affordable hearing aids because of insurance access.\n \n\n Over-the-counter hearing aids are intended for people with mild to moderate hearing loss and offer a more affordable option.\n \n\n “To me, the analogy would be reading glasses you buy at the drug store,” Dr. Piper says. “You don’t get a professional with it. It’s plug and play.”\n \n\n She says over-the-counter hearing aids will not be appropriate for someone with significant or asymmetrical hearing loss.\n \n\n “But it may be entry level for someone who has been hesitant to try hearing aids. Patients wait on average seven years from diagnosis to pursuing amplification, and we know that sustained, untreated hearing loss can lead to cognitive decline,\"" she says. \""So this may be a cost-effective way to help them.”\n \n\nWhen to Seek a Hearing Evaluation\n---------------------------------\n\n For more serious hearing loss, it’s important to have a comprehensive hearing evaluation by an audiologist . The evaluation determines degree of hearing loss and includes questions about a patient’s particular hearing challenges, lifestyle, communication needs and environment.\n \n\n “Hearing loss is not the same for every patient,” Dr. Piper says. “Everybody’s lifestyle is unique; everybody’s perception of their hearing loss is different. It’s really important to have that conversation.”\n \n\n The smallest and least visible type of hearing aid is molded to fit completely in the ear canal. It’s suited for people with mild to moderate hearing loss. Custom programming and fitting of hearing aids is important in cases of advanced hearing loss.\n \n\n You will find a wide range of sizes, styles and features. Some hearing aids go behind the ear, others fit in the ear or in the ear canal. You can choose rechargeable batteries or disposables, and technologies such as remote control and Bluetooth to stream music, podcasts and such.\n \n\n “The style is typically driven by the degree of hearing loss,” Dr. Piper says. “The completely in the canal hearing aid is not appropriate for everyone. It depends on hearing loss, dexterity required to manipulate the devices and whether they want rechargeable or disposable batteries.”\n \n\n UH audiologists can provide demonstration devices programmed for the patient’s hearing loss, so they can try them out. Dr. Piper likens the tryouts to test driving a car.\n \n\n Once a patient purchases a prescription hearing aid – typical cost is $2,000 to $6,000 a pair – they are afforded a 30-day trial period under law. Patients return to the audiologist after two or three weeks from receiving the hearing aid for any adjustments or reprogramming and additional verification of appropriate fitting.\n \n\n The technology has improved dramatically over the last five years for sound quality. Some people will find what they need with basic, less expensive technology rather than premium technology that comes with more options.\n \n\n\thttps://www.uhhospitals.org/blog/articles/2022/08/how-to-find-a-hearing-aid-thats-right-for-you\n\tBack-to-School Health and Safety: Quick Tips\tAugust 15, 2022\t[{'label': 'Child Safety', 'url': '/blog/tags/child-safety'}, {'label': 'Jerri Rose, MD', 'url': '/blog/tags/jerri-rose-md'}, {'label': \""Children's Health\"", 'url': '/blog/tags/childrens-health'}]\tFor more than 125 years,\n [University Hospitals Rainbow Babies \\&amp; Children’s](/rainbow/services) \n has been providing expert pediatric care for infants, children and adolescents in Northeast Ohio.

That Dirty Dozen and Clean 15 List is a list of the kinds of fruits and vegetables that either tend to hold on to pesticide residues more or don't. So, the Dirty Dozen are the top 12 and the degree to which they tend to hold on to pesticide residues. And then the Clean 15 are less likely to hold onto those pesticide residues. So, if you're making choices about which foods to purchase organic, that might be one way to think about it. The foods that are on the Dirty Dozen List, you might want to think about purchasing organic or maybe from a local farmer's market where there's no certification, but you can speak to the farmer and you know they're not using pesticides. Or those are just items that you want to pay a little more attention to in how carefully you wash them if you don't purchase those items organic. So, I think that the concept of organic food becomes more relevant when we think about pesticide residue. And also many families are concerned about responsible land use. And so there's some ecological issues in our food purchasing options, but it's a little bit less relevant when it comes to heavy metals.\n \n\n**Pete Kenworthy** \n\n I want to get into the homemade foods a little bit more, but before we leave jarred foods, I do have one final question for you. And it's really that if we're in the store shopping for baby food for our babies, is there something on the label that we can look for and feel confident that we're not doing a disservice to the health of our baby?\n \n\n**Dr. Aparna Bole** \n\n There is no label that will tell you about heavy metal content right now, both as it pertains to heavy metals and really other aspects of food safety. I think we have an opportunity from a regulatory and policy standpoint in this country to take a more proactive approach to things like testing, setting limits and then creating transparency for the consumer about what that looks like. Unfortunately, we don't have that framework in place for a lot of questions that parents might have about, you know, potential contaminants in foods. And as I mentioned, in addition to heavy metals, you know, we read about pesticides. We wonder about, you know, could there be, you know, certain kinds of plastics or phthalates or other kinds of packaging that could result in contaminants. So, I think parents can feel like it's this minefield when they're shopping. So, what I say to parents is the most important thing to care about is the variety of ingredients. That is, it’s simple. It's just turning it over and looking and making sure that you don't accidentally have the same first ingredient every time. Avoiding fruit juices. And then, you know, if parents have questions about the kinds of packaging or those kinds of things, I do tell parents, you know, it's a good idea, if you can, to avoid heating food in plastic. I would rather you heat in glass. It's just more inert. If you can, run your plastic food containers through the dishwater or washer, you know, high heat and plastic can result in some leaching from the plastic. And again, preferring fresh or frozen produce if you are preparing at home.\n \n\n So, those are really sort of the list. And I think parents can be in a place of just extreme stress if they're feeling like whatever choice I pick, oh my gosh, there's heavy metals in that; there's pesticides in that. It’s not the label. I think it's stressful. You know, everyone wants to do the best for their children. And I think for parents, the best piece of advice is that issue of variety, avoiding fruit juices and some of the other things that we've already talked about. And again, not losing sight of, especially when it comes to heavy metals, like let's not forget that there are other significant sources of heavy metals of concern. And especially here in Cleveland and other cities like us, lead is coming from paint, soil, housing issues by and large. So, the last thing I would want is for people to sort of be super worried about food ingredients and then forget about this other really major source.\n \n\n The one other thing I'll say is that when it comes to ingredients, we've talked a lot about arsenic and rice. It is true that there are certain ingredients in baby foods where they, not just in baby foods, certain foods that tend to hold on to other heavy metals. And one that parents may have read about or heard about are certain root vegetables like sweet potatoes and carrots. They're grown in the ground. Relatively speaking they tend to be a little bit more likely to hold on to lead from the soil than other kinds of fruits and vegetables. On the other hand, sweet potatoes and carrots have a lot"",""title"":"""",""url"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""filepath"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""chunk_id"":""0""},{""content"":""Title: uh_blogs.csv Fitzgerald** \n  \n\n Thank you for having me.\n \n\n\thttps://www.uhhospitals.org/blog/articles/2022/06/joint-replacement-a-quality-of-life-decision\n\tIs Bottled Water Healthier Than Tap Water?\tJune 21, 2022\t[{'label': 'Hydration', 'url': '/blog/tags/hydration'}, {'label': 'Wellness', 'url': '/blog/tags/wellness'}]\tNo related links found\t[{'label': 'clinical nutrition', 'url': '/services/clinical-nutrition-services'}]\t\n\n Hydration has become big business in recent years and the mind-boggling variety of water choices at the grocery store is proof. Flavored, unflavored, sparkling, distilled, purified, artesian and spring water – the choices are endless. Often labeled as healthier, natural and pure, some brands go so far as to claim their products will boost vitality and energy levels. And, although these designer hydration products don’t come cheap, people are buying them by the shopping-cart load.\n \n\n A recent advisory by the EPA warns that even tiny amounts of chemicals found in drinking water can pose risks. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), also known as “forever chemicals,” are manmade compounds found in many consumer products that have found their way into our water source. However, they’ve been traced to bottled water as well.\n \n\n So what can you do? A variety of water filters and bottled water options exist. Let’s take a closer look to help you decide.\n \n\nTap Water: Filters May Help\n---------------------------\n\n The water that comes out of your faucet is filtered, disinfected and often contains added fluoride to prevent tooth decay. Safety standards are set by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and enforced by the town, city or state where you live. So, in general, tap water is good, cheap and safe to drink.\n \n\n Some people choose to filter their tap water, either by attaching a filter to the faucet or refrigerator, using a filtered pitcher, or by installing a whole-house or under-the-sink filtration system. Different filters remove different chemicals, but most will remove or reduce contaminants such as chlorine, iron, sulfur and bacteria. Filtered water often tastes and smells better, but isn’t necessarily safer or better for you – in fact, some filters may remove the fluoride, which is beneficial for dental health. The filters also need to be replaced regularly to continue working properly.\n \n\n Consumers have multiple choices when it comes to home filtration systems, some of which can remove many, although not all, of the PFAS chemicals from their drinking water. The two most common types of filters include:\n \n\n* **Granular activated carbon (GAC).** \n GAC filters are typically those installed in a water pitcher or refrigerator. Although they vary widely in their ability to filter out PFAS, they have proven effective in removing certain chemicals and objectionable odors from drinking water.\n* **Reverse osmosis.** \n Thought to be more effective at removing PFAS, these whole-house filtration systems push water through a special membrane and several other filters to remove sediment, dirt and chemicals from the water.\n\n To filter or not-to-filter your tap water is a personal choice. The one exception is if you live in an area where the water supply is known to have high levels of contaminants. In this situation, it is a good idea to invest in a high quality water filtration system or buy bottled water for drinking.\n \n\nShopping the Bottled Water Aisle\n--------------------------------\n\n All bottled waters are regulated by the FDA and are safe to drink. Some have flavors and/or additives, so if calories or sugar are an issue, be sure to check labels for added sweeteners.\n \n\n Here’s a quick look at the different kinds of water available for purchase:\n \n\n**Purified** \n  \n\n Water that is labeled “purified” has been put through a process of reverse osmosis, meaning it is forced through a membrane to filter out chemicals, microbes and minerals.\n \n\n**Artesian** \n  \n\n Water that is sourced from an underground aquifer – a body of porous rock in the earth’s surface that is saturated with groundwater. When the aquifer is positioned between layers of nonporous rock, it puts the rock and the water it contains under intense pressure. This pressure can force the water out of the aquifer and allow it to rise to the surface naturally, or the aquifer can be tapped by a well – called an artesian well – to collect the water it contains.\n \n\n Some claim that the natural pressure acts to filter contaminants and add beneficial minerals; however, government agencies state that artesian water is really no different from regular groundwater.\n \n\n**Spring** \n  \n\n Similar to artesian water, spring water comes from underground aquifers. It is essentially groundwater that has been naturally filtered as it rises to the earth’s surface through rocks like limestone, sandstone and clay. This process of"",""title"":"""",""url"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""filepath"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""chunk_id"":""0""},{""content"":""Title: uh_blogs.csv buy it, at least in my experience.

No one I think is really immune.\n \n\n**Macie Jepson** \n\n So, Doctor, if I wanted to take my $300 now that I'm not going to spend on my detox, what would you recommend that I spend it on for my body to live a healthy life?\n \n\n**Dr. Ryan Marino** \n\n Oh, that's a good question. I mean, I think buying some more fresh fruits and vegetables, getting a good meal, whatever makes you feel good, I mean, if it's a massage. There's a lot of things that can help people just relax. I mean, the stress people put themselves under is probably another element that's contributing to health problems in society. And I don't know, if someone smokes, I mean, maybe $300 would go a long way towards like things that could help them quit. Someone drinks a lot; $300 could buy you a lot of things to distract you from wanting to drink alcohol.\n \n\n**Pete Kenworthy** \n\n Are you telling me that the age-old advice of eat right and exercise is actually it?\n \n\n**Dr. Ryan Marino** \n\n Yeah. An apple a day, something like that.\n \n\n**Macie Jepson** \n\n Oh, we come to that again.\n \n\n**Pete Kenworthy** \n\n So, before we let you go. Any sort of a minute or less summary on what this is all about? It seems like, big scam, be smarter.\n \n\n**Dr. Ryan Marino** \n\n The main takeaway is no one needs to detox. And if you think you do, you should talk to a doctor about it. But there aren't just toxins floating around in our bodies. And nothing that you buy over the counter is going to help with that. anyway. And to go back to the question you asked a minute ago about who's affected, I think this is kind of a good example of the growing pseudoscience movement that's been a problem in this country. And I think people who have a little bit of scientific knowledge and a little bit of education fall victim to this a lot. And so, these products all have some sort of like inkling of scientific. They sound like they do something. Charcoal is used in medicine. It does absorb toxins, but those little pieces just don't translate over to the whole breadth of this market.\n \n\n**Pete Kenworthy** \n\n We appreciate your time. It's been a great insight and hopefully people take something away from it like we have. We appreciate it.\n \n\n**Dr. Ryan Marino** \n\n Yeah.

"3","Is Virtual Care covered in the insurance? How do I get it?","Yes, many commercial insurance plans cover virtual care visits or allow you to submit costs to a Health Savings Account [doc3]. Coverage may vary based on your specific plan, so it's advisable to check with your insurance provider to understand the details.

To access virtual care, you can typically start by visiting your healthcare system's website, which often provides information on how to enter virtual care spaces [doc2]. If you are part of an ongoing relationship with a healthcare provider, you can discuss the possibility of scheduling virtual visits for your healthcare needs [doc2]. 

Additionally, ensure you have a reliable internet connection and the necessary technology, such as a smartphone or computer with a camera and microphone, for the virtual appointment [doc4].","{""citations"":[{""content"":""Title: uh_blogs.csv insurance coverage prior to the pandemic, the only insurances that paid prior to the pandemic on a regular basis was Medicare for rural patients, and they had to be very strict criteria to make it eligible, so much so that most providers didn’t even understand those rules and therefore didn’t participate. But as the pandemic hit and in the first months of the pandemic, over 70% of our visits in this system were performed virtually for a few months. That includes primary care, specialty care and urgent care. So most patients were being seen virtually while we figured out what was safe and what was unsafe as the healthcare system, the Federal Government, led by making these reimbursable. And while we don’t want to always associate money with our health, it was that paradigm shift that allowed healthcare systems and physicians to embrace this technology as a safe part of their practice.\n \n\n And now it is a part of our permanent model. The most important thing to address is that it’s not just for people who can’t get in. It’s an access initiative to allow people to not have to leave work, not have to leave school, whose physician might be across town if it’s a specialist and they want to see them from their home. The most important thing here is, and this is something I try to say over and over again the more I talk about telehealth and virtual care, is we should not both as patients, but also as providers and healthcare professionals, we should not be thinking of telehealth or virtual care as a binary choice between in-person visits and virtual visits. You’re not making a choice, one or the other. It’s a new tool. Don’t think of it as the visit. Think of it as a stethoscope or as an otoscope we use to look at your ears.\n \n\n It’s a tool that your providers can use to manage your personal healthcare needs. And so what I mean by that is it’s great for triage. Do I need to go, to your question earlier, about when do I go to the ER versus urgent care versus my primary care doctor’s office versus a virtual visit? The answer is it could be used to triage and help you make that decision before you commit to all night in the emergency room. It can be used to follow up on a visit that you may have not otherwise done. And we’ve actually shown some evidence and we being healthcare system that people who do a follow-up visit virtually after leaving the hospital or emergency room because they couldn’t get in with their specialist or primary care doctor are less likely to be readmitted because we’ve addressed any in-between needs that occurred since their discharge. So it is a new part of the healthcare system. It’s not an either/or.\n \n\n**Pete Kenworthy** \n  \n\n Yeah. That was the next myth on our list here is that virtual care is only for urgent care.\n \n\n**Brian Zack, MD** \n  \n\n Absolutely not. And I think, though, the biggest impact that virtual care has had now and will continue to have in the future is that it is now being used to manage chronic care, to manage how patients flow through the system. One great example will be a patient who was admitted to the hospital for congestive heart failure, one of our most common reasons for admission. When they’re discharged, they’re told to follow up with their primary care doctor and their cardiologist. When we get them in with a member of that care team within three to seven days for a virtual check-in, there are certain questions for congestive heart failure that they ask, like, has your weight gone up? Are you having difficulty with movement or going up and downstairs that would indicate you’re getting worse again? These virtual quick touch-bases that don’t involve an all day trip to the doctor are preventing people from having to be readmitted, are helping care teams pivot and readjust a treatment plan prior to their need to be seen in the office. So it’s a part of that journey.\n \n\n**Pete Kenworthy** \n  \n\n So you’re actually differentiating between two different things here. There’s scheduled virtual care where you make a scheduled appointment with your doctor, and then there’s on demand virtual care where, oh my gosh, my throat hurts, or I see this rash on me. Those are two different things, but it’s the same vehicle that gets those answers.\n \n\n**Brian Zack, MD** \n  \n\n I’m so glad you asked. That’s a really phenomenal question. So yes. Actually, the majority of virtual visits, and not by a little bit, the vast majority of virtual visits that are our system, and I would venture to say most systems are currently seeing, are in the scheduled category. Any physician who has a clinic, an outpatient clinic, can see patients either in person as we’re all used to the traditional visit or can do a virtual visit. And here at UH, an example, every single department does virtual visits, some more than others, but every"",""title"":"""",""url"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""filepath"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""chunk_id"":""0""},{""content"":""Title: uh_blogs.csv lot of people don’t understand, it’s, you brought up a sore throat or an earache, it’s okay to go to your healthcare system’s website that allows entry into the on-demand virtual spaces, if you’re not sure, and usually they’ll guide you. On our site, it very clearly says ear infections cannot be diagnosed virtually. Sore throats for a strep cannot be diagnosed virtually, but we could see you and start that process. Other things, as I mentioned earlier, certainly are immediate referrals to urgent cares or EDs, which are more risky or high acuity complaints: chest pain, shortness of breath, uncontrolled bleeding, trauma are good examples.\n \n\n As patients get more comfortable with virtual care and as providers get more comfortable, and I think it’s really important for our patients to know that not every provider has the same approach to virtual care. So it is part of that partnership and relationship you have. But if you’re part of an ongoing, regular continuity relationship with a provider, whether they be in the primary care space or a specialty space, and you see them regularly, I think having that conversation, when can we do this virtually versus when can we do this in person, is a really reasonable and now normal conversation. And providers in their own specialties will have no problem saying, when we need to get a weight, when we need to do lab work associated with your visit or other testing, we’ll have you come in. But in the in-betweens, we can do it virtually.\n \n\n**Pete Kenworthy** \n  \n\n And there are things that people may not be thinking about, right? You can have that continuum of care for chronic problems. You can have it for prescriptions that may be needed to be refilled, things like that.\n \n\n**Brian Zack, MD** \n  \n\n Correct. Anything I can prescribe in the office at current state, I can prescribe virtually. There are some limitations and they probably are going to get a little tighter on controlled substances, but that makes sense for safety. But in other realms, in terms of any blood pressure, cholesterol, antidepressants, antibiotics, if clinically appropriate, can all be prescribed virtually.\n \n\n**Macie Jepson** \n  \n\n What stands out to me in what you just said, continuum of care. Important to note, this isn’t meant to be a replacement for your physician.\n \n\n**Brian Zack, MD** \n  \n\n So this is about your physician. This is about your ability to navigate your health, your personal journey, and how health systems can be a partner and offer you resources. And virtual care is one of those resources. Some data that came out during the pandemic, just to make an example, is when you go see a primary care doctor or a specialty physician for a scheduled clinic visit, and we assume the normal average time of transportation, parking, walking in the building, checking in, waiting for the doctor or a provider, seeing them, checking out and reverse, going home compared to a virtual visit starting at home, the average virtual visit without significant delay was between 22 and 26 minutes. The average time door to door for an in-person visit was over three hours. This is why people take half days off of work for a doctor’s appointment, or they could take their break, go in a private room and do it from work or home. So the ability to access those services is actually reinforcing that continuum of care and not creating barriers.\n \n\n**Pete Kenworthy** \n  \n\n Let’s tie a bow on this. Anything else? Anything we left out or just kind of a takeaway for people here.\n \n\n**Brian Zack, MD** \n  \n\n As I think that we’ve said over and over about the value of virtual care in not being its unique, one-time visit, but about the bigger picture and your total health. As patients become more comfortable and more engaged in these options, we actually have changed, and we’re using a term called digital health, which actually means we’re looking at ways technology can be part of this journey beyond the video camera on your computer. We are using text chats to help people follow chronic conditions. We’re allowing patients to use email or e-visits to ask very simple non-complicated questions that don’t require the video. We’re looking at other technology like remote patient monitoring. So if you wear a blood pressure cuff at home or a continuous glucose monitor for diabetes, all of these equipment are now being tied digitally into our electronic medical records as part of your total picture. And we’re making sure that along with virtual visits, all this technology together is allowing our patients to stay healthy at home as opposed to sick at the hospital.\n \n\n**Pete Kenworthy** \n  \n\n Dr. Brian Zack, Medical Director for Telehealth at University Hospitals in Cleveland, thanks so much for being with us today.\n \n\n**Brian Zack, MD** \n  \n\n Thank you so much for having me.\n \n\n\thttps://www.uhhospitals.org"",""title"":"""",""url"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""filepath"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""chunk_id"":""0""},{""content"":""Title: uh_blogs.csv visits are appropriate for many conditions, including colds, flu, allergies, skin conditions, diarrhea, vomiting, sinus pain, sore throat and urinary tract infections.\n \n\n### See a UH provider and get the medical care you need, when you need it\n\n Available 7 days a week, 7 a.m. – 11 p.m. EST Learn More Other times, it’s a starting point to getting the care you need, says Brian Zack, MD , medical director for University Hospitals Telehealth.

PCOS causes the reproductive hormones to be out of balance, which can lead to the ovaries becoming enlarged and developing many small cysts.\n \n\n Symptoms of PCOS include irregular or missed periods, hirsutism (excess hair growth on the face and body), acne, glucose intolerance, weight gain or obesity, and elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Many women with PCOS also struggle with infertility. Additionally, the chronic lack of menstruation puts women with PCOS at a higher risk for uterine cancer.\n \n\n While PCOS cannot be cured, there are many options available to manage the symptoms, including options to improve fertility, says University Hospitals OB/GYN physician Diana Carmona, MD . These can include medications as well as lifestyle changes such as diet, exercise and weight loss.\n \n\nDiagnosing PCOS\n---------------\n\n Physicians use a set of criteria to diagnose PCOS. Your doctor will discuss your symptoms with you and may diagnose you with PCOS if you meet two of the following three criteria:\n \n\n* Hormone imbalance: a blood test will measure your hormones to see if you have elevated androgen levels\n* Infrequent periods (oligomenorrhea): This is defined as less than nine menstrual cycles a year\n* Polycystic ovaries: This can be determined through an ultrasound\n\nTreatment Options\n-----------------\n\n**Medications.** \n Doctors often prescribe hormonal birth control pills or an intrauterine device (IUD) to help regulate periods and manage the symptoms of PCOS. Other medications, such as Metformin, can be used to help regulate menstruation and hormones and control blood sugar.\n \n\n Dr. Carmona says women"",""title"":"""",""url"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""filepath"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""chunk_id"":""0""},{""content"":""Title: uh_blogs.csvings** \n – Identifying risk factors through screening can help prevent disease and lessen the severity of illness through early detection. One example is blood pressure screening and control – one of the most effective ways to prevent heart disease and stroke.\n \n\n**Checkups** \n – Through these visits with your primary care physician, you can learn how to manage your chronic disease -- either face-to-face during a traditional doctor’s office visit or through a virtual visit. For example, if you have a chronic heart condition, you can check in with your primary care physician to make sure you’re properly managing your condition over time.\n \n\n**Coordinating treatment** \n – Having one doctor who knows your medical history well and acts as the coordinator of your care avoids redundant medical tests and procedures, unnecessary emergency room visits and hospitalizations and medication errors.

Here's What To Expect\tJuly 26, 2020\t[{'label': 'Telehealth', 'url': '/blog/tags/telehealth'}, {'label': 'Virtual Visit', 'url': '/blog/tags/virtual-visit'}]\tUH virtual visits include online video appointments and telephone appointments, offering access to many of the same services you receive during a traditional in-person appointment, including remote symptom monitoring, diagnosis and treatment, prescriptions and other medical services.\n [Learn more](/make-an-appointment/virtual-care) \n about these services at UH.\t[{'label': 'Learn more', 'url': '/make-an-appointment/virtual-care'}]\t\n\n Meeting with your doctor online or over the phone provides a convenient, simple way to make and keep many of your appointments without having to physically go into a doctor’s office. With virtual visits, you can access many of the same services you typically receive during a traditional in-person appointment, including remote symptom monitoring, diagnosis and treatment, prescriptions, and other medical services.\n \n\n Most doctors will tell you that simply talking with their patients is one of the most important parts of their assessment. Asking patients about current symptoms, personal and family history, environment at work and home, and lifestyle habits can provide physicians with important information that can help them reach a diagnosis and develop a plan of care. As we all know, a written record of a conversation misses many small details that a live conversation picks up. Tone of voice, hesitation before answering, general appearance of fatigue or of being well-rested can all be valuable clues to health that can be picked up visually. Both elements of a traditional office visit are accomplished through an interactive virtual consultation.\n \n\n For virtual visits, a bill will be submitted to your insurance company per usual business practices. You may be responsible for a portion, or all of the cost, depending on your insurance.\n \n\nHow To Get the Most Out of Your Visit\n-------------------------------------\n\n To prepare for and get the most out of your virtual appointment:\n \n\n* Keep track of your current symptoms and when they started\n* Keep track of your temperature or blood pressure\n* Keep a list of chronic conditions and medications\n* Prepare a list of questions for your doctor\n* Have a pen and paper in case you need to take notes\n\n For online video appointments, you will also need:\n \n\n* A reliable internet connection\n* A computer, tablet or smartphone with a camera and microphone (preferably a computer/laptop)\n* Google Chrome web browser\n* Apps if directed by your doctor’s office.\n\nOther Uses of Videoconferencing\n-------------------------------\n\n Some of these same technologies are being successfully used for patients who have been admitted to one of our University Hospitals Medical Centers. This technology allows a group of individuals, such as patients, their family and clinical team members, to video chat together from multiple locations. Patients in isolation are provided with a UH iPad for this purpose, and the calls are secure and compliant with HIPAA.\n \n\n This multi-person video conferencing has already proven useful because inpatient care teams can safely interact with a patient in isolation and collaborate with each other on the patient’s plan of care. This can be used by caregivers so they do not need to enter a patient room, decreasing exposure risk, while at the same time offering their expertise. This technology enables clinical teams to remotely monitor patients at other UH facilities. Likewise, experts can visit several patients in several different locations without traveling.\n \n\n*Steven Baldridge, RN, is a staff educator at University Hospitals Samaritan Medical Center.* \n\n\thttps://www.uhhospitals.org/blog/articles/2020/07/curious-about-virtual-visits-heres-what-to-ex"",""title"":"""",""url"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""filepath"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""chunk_id"":""0""},{""content"":""Title: uh_blogs.csv single one does. So people, for example’s primary care, which was over 70% virtual during the pandemic has settled into somewhere between eight and 13% depending on the provider are still virtual. Our behavioral health departments, so we’re talking about psychiatry, psychology, counseling, are still over 80% virtual. And that is after the pandemic because it was great for access. And in the mental health space…we talked about congestive heart failure as an example as a follow-up… in the behavioral health space, more people are seeking care because the stigma of going to a provider in person for mental health is decreased. You can do it from the comfort and safety of your home, and actual compliance with treatment regimens is better because they have more resources to check in. If they’re having a side effect, they have the ability to get a quick check-in as opposed to just saying, I don’t like this, I’m just going to stop.\n \n\n**Macie Jepson** \n  \n\n This is what confuses me. How can you give me an exam for a sore throat or an ear infection or maybe an eye infection without seeing me? I feel like this is one of the misconceptions…oh, I’ve got to go in, I’ve got a sore throat. True or false?\n \n\n**Brian Zack, MD** \n  \n\n It’s both. So the answer is, of course, there are visits and complaints and medical issues that are absolutely not appropriate for virtual care, and so it’s important that as health systems build infrastructure in terms of their digital portals of entry…that’s the fancy way of saying their webpage, where patients go to find way in or their patient care apps on their smartphones…it’s really important to speak to the patient to help them navigate that. A lot of systems are actually creating apps that are about what are your symptoms and what’s the best site of care for you? But where I’m going for is there’s so much part of the physical exam that can still be done on video, and it’s really important that all patients know that here at UH, and I’m sure with every system who provides this type of care, we expect our providers to keep to the same standards of clinical care and quality metrics as they do for an in-person visit.\n \n\n So if the clinical guideline, I’ll use strep throat, a very common complaint. Strep throat should not be diagnosed virtually because there are so many different causes of a sore throat, and really the only way to know is with a swab, but that doesn’t mean we can’t meet halfway. And there are clinics that are associated with virtual visits where after the virtual visit, we send the patient a list of multiple sites they can go to on their own time to get swabbed, and the treatment team will follow up with an antibiotic if appropriate. Traumas like a fall or a car accident, of course, not appropriate for virtual. Breathing issues, chest pain, not appropriate for virtual. Those patients should go to the ER or to whoever they can be seen as quick as possible. But you mentioned eye infections. If the patient is seen virtually, and I do this from my office, if the patient’s seen virtually, we know as physicians and other providers that there are certain red flags that say this needs to be examined, but if the answers are no, we can actually do that virtually with the expectation of if this doesn’t improve or if you get A, B and C, other symptoms, come into the office.\n \n\n And this is, pivoting back to the really important point of it’s not about the one visit yes or no. It’s about that continuum and that journey. This was a way to start treatment and if it gets worse, you need to come see me. And patients are very compliant with that. They understand that we’re giving them a convenience in not having to leave work or come in. They can do it from home and we can really start their healthcare journey for this issue virtually. And if it needs to be a follow-up in person, they can do it at a more convenient time for them.\n \n\n**Pete Kenworthy** \n  \n\n Okay, so here’s one for you. Virtual care devalues the doctor-patient relationship. It doesn’t feel personal.\n \n\n**Brian Zack, MD** \n  \n\n I love that question because I couldn’t disagree more. And I love being able to share my thoughts here. In our previous discussion, I mentioned that it’s not the…I keep coming back to it…it’s not the binary visit, it’s the how does this type of tool fit into the need I have right now? And what I have found and most of our providers have agreed with is that it actually enhances the relationship for a couple of very important reasons. First, access. We are breaking down barriers to care. So if I am seeing one of my patients, they just appreciate that I’m getting them in as fast as possible"",""title"":"""",""url"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""filepath"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""chunk_id"":""0""}]}","5","

To protect your family and those around you, make time to get flu shots.\n \n\n “The CDC recommends a flu vaccine for everyone age 6 months and older,” says Amy Edwards, MD , a pediatric infectious disease specialist at UH Rainbow\n \n . “It's important to get an annual flu vaccination, especially if you or your child has a chronic health condition.”\n \n\n How much do you know about the flu? Read on for six facts about this illness-causing virus.\n \n\nThe Flu is Caused By a Virus\n----------------------------\n\n The fact that flu is caused by a virus means that it cannot be treated with antibiotics. The flu vaccine is the best way to prevent illness. While a flu shot will not make you  immune to all strains of the flu, it can make symptoms milder if you do get sick.\n \n\n “This year’s vaccine has four flu strains and is expected to protect against up to 70 percent of cases,” Dr. Edwards says.\n \n\nFlu Symptoms Tend To Come On Quickly\n------------------------------------\n\n Fever (101 degrees or higher), headache, chills, cough, sore throat, stuffy nose and body aches are symptoms of the flu. Children may have upset stomach or vomiting, but adults usually do not.\n \n\nThe Flu Can Be Life-Threatening\n--------------------------------\n\n The flu can worsen certain medical conditions or\n \n may lead to pneumonia. Each year, the flu is responsible for between 3,000 and 49,000 deaths in the United States. Dr. Edwards says there may be a higher risk for severe flu among:\n \n\n* Children ages 5 and younger\n* Adults ages 65 and older\n* Pregnant mothers\n* People with medical conditions, such as asthma, heart disease, diabetes, chronic lung problems or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or weakened immune systems\n\nYou Can Get the Flu Vaccination at Your Doctor’s Office or a Health Clinic\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Ask your doctor if you have questions. “It takes up to two weeks to get full protection from the influenza shot, so get your vaccination as early as possible,” Dr. Edwards says. “There are also now needleless vaccination options for children and adults to get their protection without the sting.”\n \n\nThe Flu Shot Does Not Cause the Flu\n-----------------------------------\n\n “When you get a flu shot, inactivated flu viruses are injected into your body. These dead viruses cannot give you the flu, but they do prompt the body to make antibodies,” Dr. Edwards says. “If you are exposed to the same strains later in the flu\n \n season, the antibodies fight the germs.”\n \n\n"",""title"":"""",""url"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""filepath"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""chunk_id"":""0""},{""content"":""Title: uh_blogs.csv find a doctor, which you can search by location.\n \n\n\thttps://www.uhhospitals.org/blog/articles/2018/08/7-tips-to-keep-enjoying-life-as-you-get-older\n\tWhat’s on Your Medicare Checklist?\tAugust 14, 2018\t[{'label': 'Baby Boomers', 'url': '/blog/tags/baby-boomers'}, {'label': 'Seniors', 'url': '/blog/tags/seniors'}, {'label': 'Men’s Health', 'url': '/blog/tags/mens-health'}, {'label': 'Men’s Health: Full-Life Fitness', 'url': '/blog/tags/mens-health-full-life-fitness'}]\tNo related links found\t[{'label': 'primary care', 'url': 'https://www.uhhospitals.org/doctors/search-results?q=Primary%20Care&amp;category=Specialty&amp;sort=Closest&amp;page=1&amp;self-scheduling=true'}, {'label': 'online tool', 'url': '/doctors'}]\t\n\n Although you can’t sign up for Medicare benefits until age 65, it's important to begin researching your options long before lighting all those candles on your cake, says internal medicine and gerontology specialist Kathleen Rogers, MD.\n \n\n Among the first decisions are when to start using Medicare.\n \n\n “I would suggest that people start looking at what's available right after their 64th birthday,” she says. “Get as much information as you can. It can be confusing, but down the line the more education you have, the better off you will be.”\n \n\nUnderstand Medicare’s ABCDs\n---------------------------\n\n The first step is understanding the various parts of Medicare and what they do. Medicare is divided into four parts, often called the ABCDs. It’s a good idea to get to know these four parts and what each covers, Dr. Rogers says.\n \n\n Dr. Rogers also recommends:\n \n\n* Compare the four parts of Medicare and decide which options best match your personal medical needs.\n* Research the expenses Medicare covers, as well as those not covered.\n* Learn about the various copays and deductibles associated with parts A and B.\n* Investigate Medigap insurance and what these private policies cover.\n* Ask your primary care physician and the medical specialists you see about specific medical conditions you have and how Medicare coverage affects them.\n\nExpert Advice\n-------------\n\n Your doctors can help with your decision-making by bringing their experience and lessons learned from helping other patients.\n \n\n “I had a patient on insulin and the plan she chose did not pay adequately so there were a lot of unexpected out-of-pocket expenses,” she says. “It's a lot to sort through and everybody’s needs are different.”\n \n\n University Hospitals offers a Medicare selection class through its Center for Lifelong Health’s Age Well, Be Well program.\n \n\n “Get as much information as you can as soon as you can,” Dr. Rogers says. “It takes a lot of time to find the perfect plan for your individual needs.”\n \n\n### Related links\n\n Looking for a primary care physician?

It also causes or exacerbates back and neck pain and spinal issues.\n \n “The average American is overly inflamed,” he says. “That's mainly because of our diet. We eat too many carbohydrates and too many bad fats, as opposed to good fats. Essentially, sugar and processed foods are destroying our bodies by causing inflammation.”\n2. **Get enough sleep.** \n It's one of the most under-appreciated components of health, Dr. Berkowitz says. When you sleep, your body does a lot of important things, including healing and clearing itself of damaging toxins and substances.\n \n “In America, we sometimes pride ourselves on the ability to function on less sleeps,” he says. “But science is increasingly pointing to the fact that most people should get seven, if not eight hours of sleep each night.”\n3. **Exercise.** \n You don’t have to be a triathlete, simply move and be active . “Take a walk or a light jog. Do some stretching,” Dr. Berkowitz says. “High-intensity interval training is real trendy now and that certainly has been shown to have some benefit. But if that's not your thing, just find an activity you enjoy to keep you moving. One of the biggest problems people have these days is they are stationary all day long.”\n4. **Reduce stress.** \n Stress has a frequently overlooked impact on your physical and mental health, Dr. Berkowitz says. He recommends 10 to 30 minutes of meditation, yoga or other techniques to relax your brain and calm your mind. These activities help lower blood pressure, and reduce cortisol, the stress hormone.\n \n “Even laughing and enjoying some time with your friends has been proven to boost a person's health,” he says.\n5. **Avoid toxins.** \n “The world is more toxic than ever from a chemical perspective, and it's having an impact on our overall health,” Dr. Berkowitz says. “We're spraying chemicals on our lawns and food. There"",""title"":"""",""url"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""filepath"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""chunk_id"":""0""},{""content"":""Title: uh_blogs.csv 'url': '/blog/tags/primary-care'}, {'label': 'Prevention', 'url': '/blog/tags/prevention'}]\tWhatever your age or stage of life, prevention is the best medicine.

Why go to the doctor if there’s nothing wrong with me, you might ask.\n \n\n When you establish a comfortable, trusting relationship with a primary care provider (PCP), you are laying the groundwork for a lifetime of good health.\n \n\n Your provider gets to know you as a person - your lifestyle, your family medical history and your risk factors for certain conditions, including heart disease, diabetes and cancer. This baseline understanding helps determine which preventive health screenings are appropriate for you and when.\n \n\n In addition, patients usually develop longstanding relationships with their PCPs. As a result, your PCP becomes very knowledgeable about your medical history. You PCP knows your previous illnesses and treatments and, as such, is more tuned in to your specific medical needs.\n \n\n Over time, you will build a medical record that your PCP has access to, giving your provider the best information when you come to them with symptoms. This is particularly important when it comes to managing chronic conditions such as asthma or diabetes.\n \n\nMost Affordable Option For Care\n-------------------------------\n\n Seeking routine care at an urgent care or emergency room can be costly and time-consuming. In comparison, when you visit your established PCP, your medical history is at hand, so each appointment can focus on the specific reason for your visit.\n \n\n Primary care visits are also the most affordable option for care – with low copays and, under many insurance plans, no-cost yearly physicals. Many employer also offer wellness incentives, which can further decrease your out-of-pocket expenses.\n \n\nEasy Access to Specialty Care\n-----------------------------\n\n Your PCP will provide the healthcare services that are most relevant and valuable to you based on their knowledge of your overall health and lifestyle. These will likely include preventive screenings, annual physical exams and strategies for the prevention and management of chronic diseases.\n \n\n Based on your specific needs, your PCP can refer you to specialty care services that can include:\n \n\n* Holistic therapies like massage, meditation and acupuncture\n* Behavioral health services like stress management programs\n* Advanced care in medical specialties like orthopedics and sports medicine\n* Ancillary services like physical therapy and nutritional counseling\n* Advanced care in medical specialties like cardiology, orthopedics and urology\n* Behavioral health services to manage stress, anxiety and depression\n* Compassionate counseling and treatments for substance disorders (alcohol and drug abuse)\n* Ancillary services like physical therapy, weight loss programming and nutritional counseling\n\nLook for Convenience, Compatibility\n-----------------------------------\n\n As with all relationships, compatibility is important, so look for a PCP who meets all your needs. Some features to look for could include the provider’s location, gender, languages spoken or insurance accepted.\n \n\n Convenience might be important to you as well. Offerings such as virtual visits, online scheduling, evening or weekend hours and 24/7 access to your health records can make it easier to track and manage your health.\n \n\n\thttps://www.uhhospitals.org/blog/articles/2021/04/young-adults-planning-for-your-healthy-future-should-start-now\n\tYour Doctor is the Best Source of Information About Kids and Vaccines\tApril 20, 2021\t[{'label': 'Vaccines', 'url': '/blog/tags/vaccines'}, {'label': 'Coronavirus', 'url': '/blog/tags/coronavirus'}, {'label': 'Parenting During COVID-19', 'url': '/blog/tags/parenting-during-covid-19'}, {'label': 'Parenting During COVID-19: Babies', 'url': '/blog/tags/parenting-during-covid-19-babies'}, {'label': 'Parenting"",""title"":"""",""url"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""filepath"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""chunk_id"":""0""}]}","5","

A strain is an injury to a muscle or a tendon, which is another kind of fibrous tissue that attaches muscles to bone.\n \n\n We asked Michael Glotzbecker, MD , Chief of Pediatric Orthopedics at UH Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital, about sprains and strains in children.\n \n\nWhat Causes Sprains and Strains?\n--------------------------------\n\n**Sprains** \n happen when a ligament suddenly stretches, twists, or tears. This injury can occur when a child falls or suffers a hit to the body. Sprains often affect the ankles, knees or wrists.\n \n\n**Strains** \n happen when a muscle or tendon is pulled or torn. This type of injury can happen suddenly, such as when a child overstretches a muscle. Or it can happen over time if a child overuses a muscle or tendon. Overuse can occur during activities that require movements that are performed over and over.\n \n\nWho is at Risk for Sprains and Strains?\n---------------------------------------\n\n Active teens or those who play sports are most at risk for a sprain or a strain. These injuries are not as common in younger children because their growth plates are weaker than the muscles or tendons in younger kids and may be injured instead of the ligament. Growth plates are areas of bone growth at the ends of long bones.\n \n\nWhat are Symptoms of Sprains and Strains in a Child?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n Symptoms of a sprain or a strain often depend on the severity of the injury and may be different in each child. Injuries to the growth plate will often present in the same way.\n \n\n The most common symptoms your child may feel in the injured area include:\n \n\n* Pain\n* Swelling\n* Warmth, bruising or redness\n* Weakness\n* Trouble using"",""title"":"""",""url"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""filepath"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""chunk_id"":""0""},{""content"":""Title: uh_blogs.csv and levels of care, University Hospitals’ highly skilled and experienced orthopedists and fellowship-trained surgeons care for the full spectrum of adult and children’s muscle and skeletal conditions, including sports injuries and every area of orthopedic specialty care.\n [Learn more](/services/orthopedic-services) \n about orthopedic services at University Hospitals.\t[{'label': 'back pain', 'url': '/services/spine-services/conditions-and-treatments/back-pain'}, {'label': 'Zachary Gordon, MD', 'url': 'https://www.uhhospitals.org/doctors/Gordon-Zachary-1770771941'}, {'label': 'Learn more', 'url': '/services/orthopedic-services'}]\t\n\n Most adults will experience back pain at some point. One of the most common medical complaints is lower back pain.\n \n\n Typically, back pain is muscular in nature and short-term, often caused by strain from lifting heavy objects or sudden movement, says UH orthopedic specialist Zachary Gordon, MD . More serious back and spine problems may be caused by nerves, joints and discs, he says.\n \n\n Most back pain will resolve on its own within a few weeks. Home care, including over-the-counter pain relievers, heat, ice and rest can help. If back pain doesn’t subside and is disrupting daily activities or sleep, you should see a doctor. A primary care physician may help in cases where pain is caused by strain or mild injury.\n \n\nWhen It’s Severe Pain\n---------------------\n\n If your pain is severe and ongoing, it’s time to see a specialist such as an orthopedist or a physical medicine and rehabilitation doctor, which is sometimes called a physiatrist, Dr. Gordon says.\n \n\n An orthopedist is a surgeon who is devoted to the prevention, diagnosis and surgical and non-surgical treatment of disorders of the musculoskeletal system – your bones, joints, ligaments, tendons and muscles.\n \n\n Some orthopedists are generalists, while others specialize in certain areas of the body such as hip and knee, foot and ankle or shoulder and elbow, Dr. Gordon says.\n \n\n A physiatrist is a medical doctor who has completed training in the specialty of physical medicine and rehabilitation and may be subspecialty certified in other areas, such as brain injury medicine, neuromuscular medicine or sports medicine.\n \n\n Physiatrists focus treatment on function and treat the whole person, not just the problem area. They have broad medical expertise that allows them to treat disabling conditions throughout a person’s lifetime.\n \n\nCauses of Severe Back Pain\n--------------------------\n\n Though muscular strain is the most common cause of back pain, there are many possible causes, Dr. Gordon says, including:\n \n\n* Arthritis\n* Compression Fractures due to osteoporosis (bone degeneration)\n* Fractured vertebrae\n* Herniated disc (sometimes called a slipped disc) or degenerative disc disease\n* Osteomyelitis (bone infection)\n* Sciatica (nerve pain)\n* Stenosis (narrowing of spaces within the spine)\n* Scoliosis (spinal deformity)\n* Spondylolisthesis (vertebrae shift)\n* Spinal cord tumor\n\n Watch for these symptoms that warrant medical attention: pain accompanied by numbness or tingling in the arms or legs; back swelling and redness (which could indicate infection), bowel or bladder problems or unintended weight loss, Dr. Gordon says.\n \n\n Also, seek medical care if pain radiates down one or both legs, he says.\n \n\n To determine the cause of chronic back pain, your doctor may order tests such as X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scan, bone scan or electromyography, which is a test to diagnose neuromuscular abnormalities.\n \n\n\thttps://www.uhhospitals.org/blog/articles/2021/10/which-doctor-is-best-to-see-when-you-have-back-pain\n\tA More Traditional Halloween Celebration is Possible This Year\tOctober 19, 2021\t[{'label': 'Coronavirus', 'url': '/blog/tags/coronavirus'}, {'label': 'Parenting During COVID-19', 'url': '/blog/tags/parenting-during-covid-19'}, {'label': 'Parenting During COVID-19: Children', 'url': '/blog/tags/parenting-during-covid-19-children'}]\tVaccinating children against COVID-19 helps provide immunity for youngsters, while helping to stem the spread of the virus and curb mutations that lead to new, more severe virus variants.\n [Find out](/services/coronavirus) \n about the authorized vaccines, how they work, possible side effects and the benefits of having your children vaccinated.\t[{'label': 'Amy Edwards, MD', 'url': 'https://www.uhhospitals.org/doctors/Edwards-Amy-1295916864"",""title"":"""",""url"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""filepath"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""chunk_id"":""0""},{""content"":""Title: uh_blogs.csv.”\n \n\n If headaches are accompanied by other troubling symptoms or neurologic problems, your doctor may order a diagnostic imaging test, such as a CT or MRI scan. But these tests are not recommended for headaches alone because they will not likely find the cause.\n \n\nWhat Causes the Pain\n--------------------\n\n Almost all people have headaches during their life. The brain tissue doesn’t have pain-sensitive nerve fibers and doesn’t feel pain. But other parts of the head can be responsible for a headache including:\n \n\n* A network of nerves that extends over the scalp\n* Certain nerves in the face, mouth, and throat\n* Muscles of the head, neck, and shoulders\n* Blood vessels found along the surface and at the base of the brain\n\n Headaches vary greatly in terms of the location and intensity of the pain, and how often they occur.\n \n\nTypes of Headaches\n------------------\n\n Headaches can be primary or secondary.\n \n\n A primary headache means the headache itself is the main health problem. But other factors such as muscle tension or exposure to certain foods may be triggers. Other things that may help cause the headache include medicines, dehydration, or hormone changes.\n \n\n A secondary headache is related to an underlying health condition. An example of this would be a headache caused by a neck injury, eye problems, or an infection in the jaw, teeth or sinus.\n \n\n Headaches often have triggers, such as stress, fatigue and certain foods and drinks. But the cause of most headaches is not well understood.\n \n\n Dr. Newton recommends headache sufferers see their primary care physician for help evaluating and managing headache pain.

They concluded that the longer a reconstructive surgery is delayed, the higher the risk of further injury. For each week that the surgical procedure was delayed, there was a 2 percent increased risk of a medial meniscal tear, compounding to a 22.8 percent increased risk over 10 weeks.\n \n\n “When we're looking at these kids who have an ACL tear, we must consider how to optimize timing from injury to surgery to give patients the greatest opportunity for excellent outcomes,\"" says study senior author and UH Rainbow pediatric orthopedic surgeon Justin Mistovich, MD .\n \n\n “We know that, historically, kids who try to play without an intact ACL have risks of early-onset arthritis, including meniscal tears and articular cartilage damage,” he says. “But until now, we didn't really have great data on the timeframe for that risk.\""\n \n\n Previous studies have used somewhat arbitrary time cut-offs to determine whether delaying ACL reconstructive surgery for one, six, 12, or 26 weeks was linked to further injury. This new study takes a different approach, measuring continuously how the risk increases over time.\n \n\n “It makes a lot more sense to look at this variable of delay to surgery as a continuous variable instead of three or four different groupings of categorical classes,\"" Dr. Mistovich says. “Nobody has ever really done that before. The power of the design of this study is that it would allow us to better categorize individual risk on a weekly basis and if there is increased risk as a function of that.\""\n \n\nEarly Care Is Important\n-----------------------\n\n For the study, the researchers retrospectively enrolled all pediatric patients at UH Rainbow and Geisinger Medical Center who had undergone ACL reconstruction between 2006"",""title"":"""",""url"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""filepath"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""chunk_id"":""0""},{""content"":""Title: uh_blogs.csv on one of those big balls. And I want to personally try an inversion table. So, I mean, please tell me some of those work.\n \n\n**Dr. A. Paul Gazzillo** \n\n There are studies currently ongoing with a lot of these different modalities that we can use.\n \n\n I am a big proponent of the ergonomic desk or making sure that you're sitting in a proper position with good posture. That can be very helpful as well as the ability to maybe take it from a seated position to a standing position. That way throughout the day you can adjust your posture and how you're, if you're sitting or standing during your work hours. And this way you can help relieve any stress or pressure on your back that could be caused from doing either one for a prolonged period of time.\n \n\n The yoga balls are also great when you're using those because you're working on your core musculature and maintaining good posture as you sit there. If you could imagine, if you have too poor a posture on a yoga ball, you're probably going to topple over. So, that's part of the key there. And it could also be used, you know, throughout the day for other exercises as you wish.\n \n\n Inversion table. Some people really do like them, as far as the ability to stretch out. It does take off some stress and pressure on the spine. I will note that a lot of the data is somewhat mixed on those because it does show short-term relief, but it's somewhat lacking in the long term benefits. So, if it's not something that you're using regularly or even multiple times a day, you may not have that sustained relief. That being said, if it provides good relief, it's easy enough to do as long as you're safe, and you have somebody with you.\n \n\n I have heard of patients who have unfortunately either gotten stuck or even had a fall off an inversion table, causing further injury. So these are all things that can happen. So, as long as you take the appropriate measures and you're safe, I think it's a reasonable thing to try.\n \n\n**Pete Kenworthy** \n\n So, lots of people have back pain as was well documented here. Let's figure out where we start, right? So, let's say you're listening to this and you have back pain, where do I go? Do I go primary care? Do I go to an ortho doc? Do I go to a neurologist? Where do I start?\n \n\n**Dr. A. Paul Gazzillo** \n\n So, if it's back pain that's been gradually increasing and isn't quite severe in nature, and you're going to see your primary care doctor for a routine checkup or another issue, that's often when back pain comes up.\n \n\n So, the treatment, you typically will start with a primary care physician who if they're comfortable enough, we'll get you into the proper physical therapy, maybe even prescribe some anti-inflammatories for you, recommend heat, ice, other conservative treatment options.\n \n\n When the pain becomes progressively worse, and you're not getting improvement or you're having significant pain shooting down the leg or any kind of neurological changes like numbness, tingling, that's certainly when you want to see a spine specialist.\n \n\n Now, typically a good 90 percent of patients are very well served seeing someone who maximizes conservative treatment options like myself, a spine specialist who can make sure they're receiving the appropriate therapy, alternative treatment options, medications as well and potentially interventional injections as we mentioned.\n \n\n So, things like epidural injections or fluoroscopic guided facet joint injections can really be beneficial. Now, if someone has significantly progressive weakness or numbness or their balance is off significantly or they have bowel or bladder changes or incontinence issues, those are all red flag signs that you want to watch out for. In that scenario, you'd be best served probably seeking surgical treatment options sooner than later as we want to stop that from getting any worse.\n \n\n**Macie Jepson** \n\n Doctor, thank you for joining us. Is there anything you want to add as we wrap up?\n \n\n**Dr. A. Paul Gazzillo** \n\n Sure. I would just like to mention that those with back pain can certainly benefit from a thorough history as well as physical exam as back pain can often be very difficult to diagnose, particularly if you're someone who doesn't see or deal with back pain routinely.\n \n\n There are also many different treatment options out there, and making sure that we have the best idea possible of what's the cause of the pain really directs that care. So, seeing someone who specializes in back pain can often be very beneficial to make sure that you're getting the appropriate physical therapy, medications, recommendations on ice, heat, other conservative modalities that we discussed earlier or even, you know, getting the appropriate injections as there are often multiple targets and multiple causes of back pain."",""title"":"""",""url"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""filepath"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""chunk_id"":""0""}]}","4","

Stem cells can help us regrow brain tissue or form our bones, form our muscles, and in this particular scenario in arthritis, help us to grow new cartilage. So, we all have our stem cells active within us here now. These new treatments help us to unleash the power of those stem cells in a more controlled fashion to treat diseases versus just doing our normal day to day building.\n \n\n**Macie Jepson** \n\n And so UH is actually FDA approved to be studying this, and actually we grow stem cells here.

The term gait analysis is often misused – many people use it to describe how a running shoe specialist evaluates your foot patterns to fit you into the appropriate running shoe.\n \n\n But a true gait analysis is done in a clinical or research facility by a licensed and trained physical therapist with the goal of helping a runner improve efficiency, avoid injury or even pinpoint the cause of an old injury.\n \n\nWhat is a Gait Analysis?\n------------------------\n\n In a gait analysis, a physical therapist performs an in-depth examination of your movement patterns while you walk or run. A gait analysis can help you improve your running form to avoid injury and run more efficiently.\n \n\n A gait analysis can involve taking a video of you as you walk or run from multiple views.\n \n\n The physical therapist also will use tests and assessments to analyze how your body looks as you run for a short distance. The way you use your feet, ankles, knees, hips and your trunk all can provide information on opportunities for improvement.\n \n\n The physical therapist also may measure the degrees and angles of your knees, ankles and hips while you walk or run.\n \n\n The physical therapist reviews deviations in arm movement, vertical displacement, trunk stability, biomechanics at certain joints, as well as cadence throughout the different phases of gait.\n \n\nWhat Does a Physical Therapist Do with Gait Information?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n These findings from the gait analysis, along with a thorough physical therapy clinical examination, allow the therapist to establish an individualized treatment plan.\n \n\n You’ll be given a personalized exercise program that addresses muscle weakness and flexibility limitations, improves movement patterns and running economy, optimizes performance, and minimizes pain.\n \n\n If appropriate, the physical therapist can provide you with information and advice to help you return to run and achieve your fitness goals.\n \n\nWho Benefits From Gait Analysis\n-------------------------------\n\n A gait analysis may be beneficial for those who enjoy running as a recreational activity, or for athletes looking to optimize their performance following an injury.\n \n\n New as well as experienced runners can benefit, since an analysis of their movement may help improve pain and decrease the likelihood of injury.\n \n\n “Video gait analysis evaluates your biomechanics and it is useful for injury treatment and prevention as well as performance enhancement,” says sports medicine specialist Laura Goldberg, MD .\n \n\n “Improving your stance, cadence, and motion positively affects your running efficiency, and more efficient means less energy cost for your effort. We recommended this for all levels of runners – from experienced endurance athletes to beginner runners.”\n \n\n*Karishma Patel, PT, is a University Hospitals physical therapist providing services at the Jewish Community Center in Beachwood.* \n\n\thttps://www.uhhospitals.org/blog/articles/2021/02/how-to-perfect-your-running-form-avoid-injury-and-improve-your-time\n\tYour Child Has a Heart Murmur: What You Need To Know\tFebruary 16, 2021\t[{'label': 'Congenital Heart Defects', 'url': '/blog/tags/congenital-heart-defects'}, {'label': 'Heart Health', 'url': '/blog/tags/heart-health'}, {'label': 'Pediatric Heart', 'url': '/blog/tags/pediatric-heart'}, {'label': 'Sarah Plummer, MD', 'url': '/blog/tags/sarah-plummer-md'}]\tThe Congenital Heart Collaborative at University Hospitals Rainbow Babies \\&amp; Children’s Hospital features a nationally recognized team of heart specialists, including pediatric cardiothoracic surgeons and pediatric cardiologists.

We are so lucky to have this as an option now for our smallest patients whose lives would otherwise be disrupted by treatment for their difficult deformity.\""\n \n\n The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the MAGEC system in 2014. Only a few U.S. facilities - including University Hospitals Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital - offer the treatment.\n \n\n MAGEC rods are not for all children with scoliosis, Dr. Hardesty says.\n \n\n “Treatment methods depend on the child's age, size, and type of scoliosis,” Dr. Hardesty says. “In addition, patients getting MAGEC rod lengthenings may need to visit the doctor's office more frequently - usually every three months.\n \n\n “Still, these clinic visits are much easier on most children and families compared to surgeries performed once or twice every year,” Dr. Hardesty says.

The child might look like he or she is leaning to one side or can look like the back, ribs, or shoulder blades are starting to rotate. The curve can happen on the left or right side of the spine, or it can appear on both sides in different places.\n \n\n For more than 80 percent of the children with scoliosis, the cause is unknown, Dr. Hardesty says. A child can be born with scoliosis or the condition may appear later in life.\n \n\n “While we commonly think of scoliosis as something that affects teenage girls, there are children who develop scoliosis in the first few years of life,” Dr. Hardesty says. “This is called early-onset scoliosis and it can be much more challenging to treat, because the spine has so much growth remaining.\n \n\n “It's important to prevent scoliosis curves from becoming severe in children because very large curves can lead to heart and lung problems,” Dr. Hardesty says.\n \n\nOngoing research into pediatric scoliosis\n-----------------------------------------\n\n UH Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital, which has one of the largest growing rod programs in the world, is a founding member of the Growing Spine Study Group (GSSG).

In addition, chronic pain and depression and anxiety go hand in hand. Many chronic pain patients are taking antidepressants, mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which many of these CYP2D6 inhibitors fit into. There are a lot of patients who experience both, unfortunately.

If we need to use opioids, a scheduled morphine or a scheduled oxycodone would avoid this interaction.”\n \n\n “For patients who have the combination of chronic pain and depression or anxiety, keep in mind that this interaction does exist,” Frost says. “And for healthcare providers, if you have a patient approaching you saying this medication isn’t working for me, ask whether there an interaction at play.”\n \n\n\thttps://www.uhhospitals.org/blog/articles/2019/06/taking-antidepressants-with-opioid-results-in-less-pain-relief-study-says\n\tMen: Don't Shy Away From Getting Help for Mental Health\tJune 23, 2019\t[{'label': 'Stress', 'url': '/blog/tags/stress'}, {'label': 'Wellness', 'url': '/blog/tags/wellness'}, {'label': 'Men’s Health', 'url': '/blog/tags/mens-health'}, {'label': 'Men’s Health: Treatment', 'url': '/blog/tags/mens-health-treatment'}]\tIf you or a man in your life would like more information on seeking mental health counseling at UH, please call\n [216-844-2400](tel:216-844-2400) \n .\n\n Learn more about\n [Men's Health services](/services/mens-health) \n at UH\t[{'label': 'mental health issues', 'url': 'https://www.uhhospitals.org/Healthy-at-UH/topics/mental-health'}, {'label': 'Robert Chester, PsyD', 'url': '/doctors/Chester-Robert-1477030401'}, {'label': 'Mental Health America', 'url': 'https://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/'}, {'label': 'Mantherapy.org', 'url': 'https://mantherapy.org/'}, {'label': '216-844-2400', 'url': 'tel:216-844-2400'}, {'label': \""Men's Health services\"", 'url': '/services/mens-health'}]\t\n\n When it comes to mental health issues , men are notoriously difficult to reach and treat.\n \n\n For one, they often don’t recognize there may be a problem.\n \n\n Take depression, which affects nearly 6 million U.S. men. In women, it often shows up as crying, loss of energy or hopelessness. But in men, it manifests quite differently.\n \n\nMany Men Avoid Expressing Emotions\n----------------------------------\n\n “Men tend to be externalizers, meaning that they tend to do things that we would consider acting out– anger, aggression, that kind of thing,” says UH psychologist Robert Chester, PsyD . “These symptoms can be missed if you’re only thinking in a certain way about depression.\n \n\n \""Plus, men tend to avoid emotional expression,\"" Dr. Chester says. \""That avoidance is one reason why they have higher rates of addiction issues than do women.”\n \n\n About 20 percent of U.S. men develop alcohol dependency at some point during their lives, according to Mental Health America .\n \n\nThe Stigma of Seeking Help\n--------------------------\n\n Complicating this picture is the stigma many men feel about seeking help for or even discussing mental health issues.\n \n\n “They often don’t want to admit they have something they need help with, let alone a mental health issue,” Dr. Chester says. “There’s the whole idea of looking weak.\n \n\n “Men are also probably more skeptical of psychotherapy in general,\"" he says. \""I think most people kind of are, but men are in particular because they think of it as touchy-feely.”\n \n\nHumor Can Help\n--------------\n\n So what can break this cycle? How can men be encouraged to get the mental healthcare they need?\n \n\n Dr. Chester has extensive experience working with military veterans. One tactic that he says has worked with male veterans and other male patients is using humor.\n \n\n “Men tend to respond more strongly to humor, and when it comes to veterans, dark humor,” he says. “Humor can help to break the ice and get them interested.”\n \n\n Dr"",""title"":"""",""url"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""filepath"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""chunk_id"":""0""},{""content"":""Title: uh_blogs.csv of their patients, the AAFP reports. And two-thirds of patients with depression receive treatment for their depression in the primary care setting, the AAFP says.\n \n\n Adults made an annual average of 30 million mental health-related physician office visits between 2012 and 2014, according to data published in 2018 by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While psychiatrists provided care for 55 percent of these visits, primary care physicians provided care for 32 percent.\n \n\n So you don’t have to wait for an appointment with a psychiatrist if you feel the need for mental healthcare services. You can bring up any concerns about your mental or emotional health with your primary care provider.\n \n\n This has become even more important in the COVID-19 pandemic era, as many lives have been upended due to working from home, remote classes, joblessness, grief and isolation.\n \n\nMental Health Services Often Start With Primary Care\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n Most psychiatric care starts with a primary care provider, even if a patient eventually winds up seeing a mental health professional. This is because many primary care providers screen their patients for depression during their annual visit, as recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).\n \n\n A simple two-question inquiry is often the starting point. Your primary care provider asks you how often, over the last two weeks, you have had little interest or pleasure in doing things or were feeling down, depressed or hopeless.\n \n\n If your responses indicates depression is likely, and then you will be asked a few more questions. Depending on your responses and symptoms, your primary care provider may prescribe antidepressants, give you a referral for psychotherapy services, or both.\n \n\nHow a Primary Care Provider Can Help\n------------------------------------\n\n Many primary care offices have begun to embed a social worker or behavioral health manager as part of the care team. In this way, mental healthcare can be conveniently managed at the primary care office. The social worker or behavioral health manager can meet with you in a phone call or in a video chat between appointments with your primary care provider.\n \n\n As part of your primary care team, a social worker or behavioral health manager will discuss your symptoms, history and treatment and work with you to address your mental health needs, as well as provide brief therapy and education. The social worker works with your primary care provider to develop the best plan for your mental healthcare and consult with a psychiatrist who can guide your care to ensure high-quality treatment or connect you with other mental health specialists.\n \n\n For many patients, a prescription for antidepressants and follow-up visits may be all they will need. A primary care provider can choose from several antidepressants to safely prescribe to their patients; follow up visits with a primary care provider tend to be much shorter than a therapy session with a psychiatrist.\n \n\n If you do not show improvement after a few months, your primary care provider may decide to change your medication or might recommend starting psychotherapy if it wasn’t part of the initial plan.\n \n\n Primary care providers most commonly treat depression, anxiety and emotional distress related to grief. People with conditions that are more difficult to treat, such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia , will typically need to see a psychiatrist. But once the person’s condition is stable, a primary care provider can often take over the role of prescribing medication refills.\n \n\n Your primary care provider also can help to find a psychotherapist, though a referral usually isn’t needed.\n \n\n\thttps://www.uhhospitals.org/blog/articles/2021/03/your-primary-care-provider-can-help-treat-your-mental-health-too\n\tWith Pregnancy Loss, Support Is Available\tMarch 17, 2021\t[{'label': 'Pregnancy and Childbirth', 'url': '/blog/tags/pregnancy-and-childbirth'}]\tNo related links found\t[{'label': 'pregnancy loss', 'url': '/services/obgyn-womens-health/conditions-and-treatments/high-risk-pregnancy/conditions-and-treatments/pregnancy-loss'}, {'label': 'Courtney Steer\\\\-Massaro, CNM', 'url': '/doctors/SteerMassaro-Courtney-1235482043'}, {'label': 'Learn more', 'url': '/services/obgyn-womens-health/conditions-and-treatments/pregnancy-and-childbirth'}]\t\n\n When pregnancy loss happens, people often feel alone and isolated.

The amygdala is the part of the brain that generates emotional responses to our environment. Because of this, it’s not uncommon for someone with an anxiety disorder to also experience depression or vice versa.\n \n\n Almost one half of people diagnosed with depression are also diagnosed with an anxiety disorder at some point in their life. What’s more, anxiety can occur as a symptom of clinical depression, while anxiety disorders and panic disorder can trigger depressive episodes. Having anxiety and depression simultaneously can also worsen the symptoms of each disorder or make them last longer.\n \n\nTreating Anxiety and Depression\n-------------------------------\n\n Anxiety and depression are both treatable mental illnesses. A proper diagnosis by a doctor or mental health specialist must occur before treatment of an anxiety disorder or clinical depression can begin. If you are diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, depression or both, your healthcare provider will recommend a treatment plan individualized for your needs. Your treatment may include one or more of the following:\n \n\n* Psychotherapy (also called talk therapy), including cognitive-behavioral therapy, which is designed to help people manage problems by changing the way they think and behave.\n* Lifestyle changes, including regular exercise and stress relief techniques.\n* Dietary changes.\n* Medication management, including taking antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications.\n* For depression that does not respond to medication or other first-line treatments, other treatments your doctor may recommend include electroconvulsive therapy , repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and ketamine infusion .\n\n**Related Links** \n\n Signs and symptoms of clinical depression and anxiety should not be ignored. University Hospitals has a wide network of primary care physicians and behavioral health professionals at convenient locations across the region who can diagnose and treat all types of depression, anxiety and other mental health disorders.\n \n\n\thttps://www.uhhospitals.org/blog/articles/2023/01/is-it-anxiety-depression-or-both\n\tCan You Overdose on Nuts?\tJanuary 25, 2023\t[{'label': 'Diet and Nutrition', 'url': '/blog/tags/diet-and-nutrition'}, {'label': 'Jessica Jurcak MS MPH RD LD', 'url': '/blog/tags/jessica-jurcak-ms-mph-rd-ld'}]\tUniversity Hospitals has a team of\n [clinical dietitians](/services/clinical-nutrition-services) \n with the knowledge and experience to help you achieve total, balanced nutrition; reach or maintain an optimum weight; and prevent or manage chronic health conditions through dietary strategies.\t[{'label': 'high blood pressure', 'url': '/services/heart-and-vascular-services/conditions-and-treatments/high-blood-pressure'}, {'label': 'clinical dietitians', 'url': '/services/clinical-nutrition-services'}]\t\n\n When your stomach rumbles between meals, a handful of nuts is a quick snack that’s tasty and good for you. Delicious and nutritious, nuts are full of fiber, high in protein and contain minerals, antioxidants, healthy fats and other compounds that can greatly benefit your health. And unlike other popular snacks, they are more likely to satisfy your appetite and keep you from reaching for more, less healthy foods.\n \n\nNutty for Nuts? Don’t Overdo It\n-------------------------------\n\n The expression “everything in moderation” is especially important when talking about nut consumption. Because they are such a nutrient- and calorie-dense food, portion control is essential to avoid excess weight gain. More importantly, eating too many nuts can actually lead to food toxicity which can range from mild symptoms to severe illness. In addition, many nut varieties contain the amino acid L-Arginine, which can cause mouth ulcers if you over-indulge.\n \n\n The health benefits of nuts vary depending on which type you eat, but a daily serving of nuts generally helps to:\n \n\n* Support heart and vascular health\n* Reduce risk of stroke\n* Enhance digestion\n* Contribute to healthier skin\n* Reduce blood clotting\n* Help curb the appetite\n\n In addition, some studies have shown that when a handful of nuts is eaten as a replacement for less-healthy foods, it may help prevent obesity.\n \n\n In general, one ounce of nuts a day is the guideline most dietitians recommend for people without medical contraindications or nut allergies. Some common snack nuts are discussed in more detail below:\n \n\n**Almonds** \n  \n\n Almonds are often referred to as a “super food” and rightly so.

However, if you experience feelings of anxiety or depression for long stretches of time that have a significant negative impact on your quality of life, you may have an anxiety disorder or clinical depression.\n \n\nWhat Is Anxiety?\n---------------- Anxiety is a general fear or apprehension about what will happen or could happen in the future. Feelings of worry, nervousness, uneasiness or dread are all examples of anxiety.\n \n\n Affecting about 40 million adults in the US age 18 and older every year, anxiety disorders represent the most common mental illness in the country. About 30 percent of adult Americans develop an anxiety disorder at some point during their lives.\n \n\n Anxiety can cause you to feel restless and tense, sweat and have a rapid heartbeat. However, anxiety is a healthy and normal emotional reaction to stress, particularly when we are faced with a difficult problem or have to make an important decision. Normal occurrences of anxiety can help people cope with a problem by providing a boost of energy and sharpening mental focus. However, for people who have an anxiety disorder, feelings of fear and nervousness are not temporary and may interfere with their job performance, schoolwork, relationships and other aspects of daily life.\n \n\n The most common anxiety disorders, each which has its own symptoms, are:\n \n\n* **Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)** \n : People with GAD worry excessively about many ordinary things, including health, finances, work, and family. If a person experiences excessive worrying about these things for six months or more, they may have GAD.\n* **Social anxiety disorder** \n : Social anxiety disorder is an intense, persistent fear of being watched, judged or rejected by other people that occurs in the presence of others. In addition to affecting work, school, and other daily activities, this type of anxiety can cause difficulties in a person’s ability to make and keep friends.\n* **Panic disorder** \n : People with panic disorder experience sudden feelings of intense fear accompanied by distinct physical symptoms, including a pounding heart, chest pain, sweating, shortness of breath, and trembling.\n* **Phobias** \n : A phobia is an intense, irrational fear of something that poses little or no actual danger.\n \n Common phobias include the fear of spiders, flying, closed spaces, and being in a crowd.\n* **Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)** \n : In this anxiety disorder, unwanted and repeated thoughts, feelings, ideas, sensations, or obsessions cause a person to do something repeatedly.\n\nWhat Is Depression?\n------------------- Depression , also called major depression and clinical depression, is a persistent feeling of sadness than can be accompanied by a sense of hopelessness. Other symptoms of depression may include:\n \n\n* Loss of interest in activities the person once enjoyed\n* Loss of energy\n* Reduced motivation\n* Feelings of guilt or shame\n* Increased or decreased appetite\n* Insomnia (trouble falling or staying asleep) or hypersomnia (trouble staying awake and alert during the day despite getting an adequate"",""title"":"""",""url"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""filepath"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""chunk_id"":""0""},{""content"":""Title: uh_blogs.csv Childhood Depression\n-------------------------------------\n\n If you suspect your child is suffering from depression, Dr. Burkhart says these are 11 warning signs to watch out for:\n \n\n1. **Changes in sleeping habits.** \n Sleeping too little, too much or taking long naps regularly may be warning signs of depression.\n2. **Not wanting to participate in activities or not enjoying activities once enjoyed.**\n3. **Withdrawing from friends and family.**\n4. **Trouble thinking or concentrating.** \n This may not be ADHD, but rather a sign of depression.\n5. **Weight loss or gain, or changes in appetite.** \n Eating too much and not eating enough can be signs of depression.\n6. **Decline in academic performance.**\n7. **Fatigue or loss of energy.**\n8. **Self-harm.** \n This can take many forms, including cutting, picking, scratching or even hitting themselves.\n9. **Lacking self-confidence or self-esteem, and feelings of worthlessness.** \n People with depression often feel like they can't do anything right, are not liked and/or they're not good at anything.\n10. **Feelings of hopelessness.** \n When we think about someone being depressed, we look to see if they are experiencing negative thoughts about themselves, about others and about the future.\n11. **Recurrent thoughts of death or suicide.**\n\nTreatment for Childhood Depression\n----------------------------------\n\n Childhood depression can happen because of external factors, such as stress, bullying or a traumatic event, Dr. Burkhart says.
