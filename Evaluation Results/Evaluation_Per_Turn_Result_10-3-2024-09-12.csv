"1","Are intrusive thoughts harmful?","Intrusive thoughts are generally not considered harmful. According to Dr. Robert Chester, a clinical psychologist, while these thoughts can be unsettling, they do not necessarily indicate a mental illness or a hidden desire to act on them. Studies have shown that individuals who experience intrusive thoughts are not more likely to act on them [doc1]. 

In fact, intrusive thoughts may serve a protective function, reminding individuals of their values and fears. For example, a sudden urge to jump from a height might prompt someone to step back, reinforcing their instinct for safety [doc1].","{""citations"":[{""content"":""Title: uh_blogs.csvry-psychology'}, {'label': 'primary care physicians', 'url': '/services/primary-care'}, {'label': 'behavioral health professionals', 'url': '/services/behavioral-health'}]\t\n\n Has an unsettling thought or a disturbing image ever popped into your head, seemingly from out of nowhere? If you answered yes, you are one of six million Americans who have experienced intrusive thoughts.\n \n\nWhat Are Intrusive Thoughts?\n----------------------------\n\n Intrusive thoughts are unwanted ideas and images that come to mind unexpectedly. These thoughts can be directed towards yourself, your loved ones or people who just happen to be nearby at the moment.\n \n\n Some common examples include:\n \n\n* A parent thinking about hurting their baby or child.\n* A fleeting urge to jump when standing on a bridge or rooftop of a tall building (a phenomenon also known as “the call of the void” or “the high place phenomenon”).\n* Thoughts of running your car off the road or swerving into oncoming traffic.\n* Thoughts about doing something embarrassing; for example, shouting obscenities or doing something inappropriate in public.\n\nAre Intrusive Thoughts Harmful?\n-------------------------------\n\n “The short answer is no,” says Robert Chester, PsyD , a clinical psychologist with University Hospitals Department of Psychiatry. “Although intrusive thoughts can be unsettling, they are not always a sign of mental illness or an indication that you have a hidden desire to follow through with the disturbing or strange thought that arose in your mind.”\n \n\n What’s more, multiple studies have shown that people who have intrusive thoughts are not more likely to act on them.\n \n\nWhat Causes Intrusive Thoughts?\n-------------------------------\n\n Stress is the most common trigger for intrusive thoughts. But even people with normal or low stress levels can experience the occasional intrusive thought. Most intrusive thoughts fall into one of the following categories, which can feel understandably disturbing:\n \n\n* A phobia or deep-seated fear\n* Embarrassing or shameful\n* Immoral or against your values\n* Violent or sexual in nature\n\n So, what prompts a healthy brain to produce ideas that are disturbing – or even at odds with – who you are? Some researchers believe intrusive thoughts are a type of misinterpreted warning signal, a sort of brain hiccup.\n \n\n “Intrusive thoughts may serve to protect us from our deepest fears or potential dangers,” says Dr. Chester. “For example, the sudden urge to step off a bridge causes you to step back. Similarly, the mother who has an intrusive thought about hurting her baby nearly always reacts with feelings of horror because her baby’s well-being is all that matters. Ultimately, intrusive thoughts remind us of the things we value the most in our lives.”\n \n\nHow to Stop Intrusive Thoughts\n------------------------------\n\n Here are some tips to help manage intrusive thoughts:\n \n\n* **Identify and recognize the intrusive thought** \n . A thought may be intrusive if:\n+ It’s very different from your usual thoughts.\n+ It’s disturbing and bothersome to you, and you want to rid your mind of it.\n+ The thought feels difficult to control – intrusive thoughts are typically repetitive and often get “stuck in your head.”\n\n* **Don’t fight it.** \n When you have an intrusive thought, try to accept it. As unsettling as they may feel, intrusive thoughts usually go away if you accept them without focusing on them or trying to push them away.\n* **Don’t judge yourself** \n . Remind yourself that having this type of unusual or alarming thought does not mean that something is wrong with you. Thoughts are not the same as behavior.\n\nWhen to Seek Help\n-----------------\n\n You should seek the help of a mental health professional if your intrusive thoughts are disruptive to your daily life, especially if they interfere with your ability to work or to do things you enjoy. A therapist can help determine if intrusive thoughts are a symptom of a mental health condition, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), generalized anxiety disorder, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n \n\n Many people learn to manage intrusive thoughts with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), which helps patients change thought patterns. In addition, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and certain other antidepressant medications can be effective in managing intrusive thoughts.\n \n\n “Psychologists are here to help, not judge,” adds Dr. Chester.  “Please do not be ashamed to share your intrusive thoughts with us. We’ve heard it all.”\n \n\n**Related Links** \n\n Signs and symptoms of mental illness should not be ignored. University Hospitals has a wide network of primary care physicians and behavioral health professionals at convenient locations across the region who can diagnose and treat all types of depression, anxiety and other mental health disorders.\n \n\n\thttps://www.uhhospitals.org/blog/articles/2024/02/why-do-people-have-intrusive-thoughts\n\tBreathe Your Way to Better Health &amp; Less Stress\tFebruary 06, 2024\t[{'label': 'Deep Breathing', 'url': '/blog/tags/deep-breathing"",""title"":"""",""url"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""filepath"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""chunk_id"":""0""},{""content"":""Title: uh_blogs.csv, crowds. What about anxieties that are harder to explain, emotional anxieties that may not manifest themselves in everyday actions that you’re avoiding? Does that make sense?\n \n\n**Dr. Robert Chester** \n  \n\n I would want to clarify first, too, that we want to make sure that we understand it’s not the situation that’s causing us anxiety, which seems counterintuitive, but it’s what we’re telling ourselves about the situation. So, that’s why like I’m able to go in a crowd and I’m fine, but someone else might have an issue, because I don’t tell myself the things that they tell themselves. That’s a big part of it, but something like, you know, just worrying generally about the future, that can be tough, because you feel like you should, and there’s a part of you that really should like productively think about the future, cause then you can make plans for it. But if you get to the point where you’re like predicting that, you know, you’re going to lose your job or you’re going to, your wife’s going to leave you or something like that, if you don’t have any evidence for that, then you’re just making yourself miserable for no reason. But you got to be able to pay attention to your thoughts in order to get to that point in the first place.\n \n\n**Pete Kenworthy** \n  \n\n But paying attention to those thoughts, doesn’t make it go away.\n \n\n**Dr. Robert Chester** \n  \n\n No.\n \n\n**Pete Kenworthy** \n  \n\n Right?\n \n\n**Dr. Robert Chester** \n  \n\n Right. Yeah. So, the first step is making sure not only paying attention, but seeing if they fit into those different categories of cognitive distortions like I talked about earlier. Once you figure that out, then it’s the challenging of the thoughts time, which you can do on your own. You don’t need me, but I can help guide people through that process on how to do it. And it could be nice, you know, hearing another person’s perspective, especially, you know, someone who doesn’t have, you know, an emotional investment in the person or their, I mean, I can have some of that as a therapist, but I’m not living with them every day. You know, there’s a big difference there. If you are, that can be really hard to cope with someone who has a lot of anxiety, because you know it’s irrational, they know it’s irrational, but they can’t stop themselves from doing it.\n \n\n So, this is why people say, oh, just stop worrying. I mean, if that worked, I wouldn’t have a job. So, that doesn’t work. It just makes people worry more and get angry at you for it. So, there are times when it would be beneficial to see someone like me who can guide you that process and how to challenge these thoughts. But it starts with looking for evidence. And when I say evidence, I mean it more in the legal sense, really, like what is some evidence that would convince a jury that your thought’s accurate or correct? Not, you know, it just feels right. You need something more like, well, this has happened to me before or something like that. That doesn’t necessarily mean it’s going to happen again, but that can be some evidence that it could happen at least. And that evidence against, of course, you know. What are some of the reasons why this is unlikely to happen? I try to get people away from thinking about possibilities and thinking more about probabilities, which is a big deal, cause anything is possible. And if we worry about that, then we’re really going to be stuck. But if we can think about, well, what’s likely, or what’s probable to happen? Everything in life carries risks. So, we need to always be weighing that pretty much.\n \n\n**Pete Kenworthy** \n  \n\n You talk about how it might be beneficial for some people to come talk to someone like you. How do we know when it’s that time? Right? That’s kind of the key here. Right? Lots of people worry. Lots of people, everybody has anxiety. Right? But not everybody needs to come talk to you. If we’re living with someone who we think maybe borderline disorder or maybe has a disorder or we’re that person ourselves, how do we know? How do we know when it hits that point to come talk to you or to talk to someone about medication or any of those kinds of measures?\n \n\n**Dr. Robert Chester** \n  \n\n I think when it starts to affect your functioning in a negative way. So, if you’re avoiding a lot of things and that’s starting to impact, you know, your grades in school, cause you’re missing classes all the time, that would be a great indication to come see someone like me, cause you’re stuck now in that kind"",""title"":"""",""url"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""filepath"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""chunk_id"":""0""},{""content"":""Title: uh_blogs.csv PsyD', 'url': '/doctors/Ahmed-Samina-1104256916'}, {'label': 'Carolyn Landis, PhD', 'url': '/doctors/IeversLandis-Carolyn-1376564732'}, {'label': 'Learn more', 'url': '/rainbow/services/sleep-medicine'}, {'label': 'Learn more.', 'url': '/services/pulmonary-and-sleep-services/conditions-and-treatments/sleep-disorders'}]\t\n\n If you use sleeping aids – whether prescription or non-prescription – you've likely heard or read that this is not an ideal long-term solution for insomnia . Nevertheless, some 10 million Americans use prescription medicines, and millions more rely on over-the-counter remedies.\n \n\n If you have had insomnia for a long time, it might be frightening to contemplate going off those medicines. There is another solution that studies have shown to be effective – Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), provided through four to six sessions with a trained therapist.\n \n\n First, though, you likely have insomnia if you experience:\n \n\n* Struggling to fall asleep, taking longer than 20 minutes at least three times a week to do so.\n* Waking up frequently through the night and struggling to return to sleep.\n* Waking up often before your alarm and feeling unrefreshed.\n* Your sleep difficulties affecting your ability to perform your best at work or to complete daily tasks.\n\n If you have acute insomnia that has recently occurred because of life stressors, a physician might prescribe a temporary prescription of hypnotic medication or other sleep aids. But for chronic insomnia (more than three months of continued sleep difficulties), CBT-I is at least as effective as medication in the short-term and more effective in the long-term.\n \n\n CBT-I is based on scientific knowledge of sleep. The cognitive part focuses on your thoughts, feelings and expectations about sleep and insomnia, all of which may affect how well you sleep. The behavioral part of CBT-I helps you develop proven sleep habits and reduce problematic behaviors contributing to insomnia. We talked with Samina Ahmed, PsyD , a UH clinical psychologist with specialized training in CBT-I treatment for adults, to learn more about this therapy.\n \n\nQ. We've all heard a lot about the importance of sleep hygiene. Is that what CBT is about?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n A. No, it's much more. Sleep hygiene, in which you adopt habits such as going to bed at the same time each day, keeping your bedroom cool and quiet, and not using electronic devices for a few hours before sleep, is not enough to treat insomnia. But it's a good place to start. I spend perhaps 10 minutes in the first session talking about sleep hygiene. The rest of the time is spent learning about the patient's current sleep behaviors, how the patient is addressing the sleep problems and any stress or life changes that might be contributing to poor sleep. The session concludes with an introduction to CBT-I and the importance of tracking their sleep patterns on a sleep log so I can adapt the treatment to the individual needs of each patient.\n \n\nQ. What happens at later sessions?\n----------------------------------\n\n A. After that, each session starts with a review of sleep log data to see what recommendations helped and what continues to be problematic. I typically start with making behavioral changes around sleep, and then cognitive changes – such as challenging negative thoughts around sleep and fear about what will happen if you don't get enough sleep. Cognitive restructuring may sound difficult to practice but is an important component of treatment. Treatment concludes with relapse prevention; the idea is to provide patients with a toolkit of what they can do to address insomnia should it come back.\n \n\nQ. What is wrong with taking a prescription medicine such as Ambien (zolpidem tartrate) to fall asleep?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n A. This is largely dependent on individual cases but overall, hypnotics were created to be taken on a short-term basis. Long-term use of Ambien might promote sleep, but is likely suppressing deep sleep or REM sleep. With time, the medication might lose its effectiveness and you might find yourself needing a higher dose to achieve the same effect. When you get older, there is also a greater fall risk due to side effects of the medication.\n \n\nQ. Some people takes benzodiazepines to help them sleep. Is that worrisome?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n A. Yes, those can be highly addictive and foster a dependence on the medication. Benzodiazepines also are likely to lead to daytime grogginess and present with some of the same concerns as long-term hypnotic use. With that said, it is important to manage anxiety to promote sleep. I find patients function better with daytime use of benzodiazepines or other anxiolytics with emphasis on relaxation at bedtime.\n \n\nQ. Does anxiety about falling asleep affect the ability to fall asleep?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n A. Absolutely, the greater the pressure to fall asleep the harder it is to go to sleep"",""title"":"""",""url"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""filepath"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""chunk_id"":""0""},{""content"":""Title: uh_blogs.csv.pandora.com/podcast/the-science-of-health-podcast/PC:50484/'}, {'label': 'Spotify', 'url': 'https://open.spotify.com/show/41zIrk1mwWSQnawaAjVzmX'}, {'label': 'Patrick Runnels, MD', 'url': '/doctors/Runnels-Patrick-1558374645'}, {'label': 'Dr. Patrick Runnels', 'url': '/doctors/Runnels-Patrick-1558374645'}, {'label': '*A World Without Email*', 'url': 'https://www.calnewport.com/books/a-world-without-email/'}]\t\n\n**Subscribe:** Apple Podcasts \\| YouTube Podcasts \\| Pandora \\| Spotify *Text messages, emails, news notifications and social media have us in a heightened state of stimulation. While some of that information is positive, turning off the stimuli, even temporarily, has tremendous upside.

Being in the moment decreases anxiety and stress and allows us to be happier overall.* \n\n---\n\n**Macie Jepson** \n  \n\n So, Pete, when was the last time you were totally alone with your thoughts? I’m talking no telephone, not even the TV in the background, just you and your brain.\n \n\n**Pete Kenworthy** \n  \n\n Yeah, it’s a hard one, right? I have a hard time with that, actually. I honestly can’t think of a time when it’s just my brain and me. I almost always have my phone nearby or something on the TV. When I’m driving, I have music on. So really, I’m never alone with my thoughts. The only time is maybe when I’m sleeping, right?\n \n\n**Macie Jepson** \n  \n\n Yeah. Same, same. You know, when I do have downtime, I catch up on stuff; my texts, what’s happening in the world. When I’m cooking, I listen to music in the background. Really, the only time that I am completely alone with my thoughts is when I meditate, and by the way, I’m really bad at it. So, what are we missing when we don’t spend time with ourselves? And I’ve often asked myself, are there any benefits to being bored? Hi everybody, I’m Macie Jepson.\n \n\n**Pete Kenworthy** \n  \n\n And I’m Pete Kenworthy. This is\n *Healthy@UH* \n . Our brains today are wired for stimulation, and it’s hard for most of us to turn off the noise. So, are our brains and emotions suffering from the lack of one-on-one time with ourselves? Joining us today is Dr. Patrick Runnels , Chief Medical Officer of Population Health and Vice Chair of the Department of Psychiatry at University Hospitals, Cleveland Medical Center. Thanks for joining us.\n \n\n**Dr. Patrick Runnels** \n  \n\n Great to be here. Thanks for having me.\n \n\n**Pete Kenworthy** \n  \n\n So, let’s start with being overly connected. Is it unhealthy?\n \n\n**Dr. Patrick Runnels** \n  \n\n When you talk about being overly connected, there are two ways in which that can be tough on your brain. Part of that is the amount of information you’re getting and how it’s affecting you emotionally. And part of that is just the act of being connected and not being able to kind of turn off your brain or turn off the connection or really be alone with your thoughts. To start that first piece, when we think about everyone who’s been so connected, especially the last two years, but this has been the trend, what we know is that there is a lot of emotion that starts to get tied to the idea of having a whole lot of information coming at us. So, think about being on a Facebook page or on a Twitter feed, and you’re constantly getting bombarded with these very intense messages. And intensity can be defined a lot of ways.\n \n\n If I’m on Twitter, one form of intensity, for instance, right now would be seeing a lot of tweets about the Ukrainian War. And the Ukrainian War might be really stressful. You know, for a lot of people, it\n *is* \n really stressful. It’s a very stressful, big, big deal. And if I’m constantly getting input every second, every few seconds new tweets coming on about that, then I’m going to start to exhort that anxiety. It’s like kind of rapidly throwing something in your face all the time. The same thing goes though for just the idea of having a lot of back and forth around any information, right? So, as I have more and more information coming at me and I’m trying to, you know, I’m trying to kind of absorb one piece of information. The second piece of information comes at me. And it"",""title"":"""",""url"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""filepath"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""chunk_id"":""0""},{""content"":""Title: uh_blogs.csv at.\n \n\n And one of the phenomena, just to give an example of that, that I hear all the time in the patients I see, is people coming in and saying, I can’t sleep well at night. And I ask them what their sleep is like. And they’ll say some version of, well, I get in bed and I fall asleep and then I wake up and I got to check my phone and I got to look at my emails or I got to see if someone texted or I got to see some version of what’s going on in the news. I can’t get the news off my mind. The New York Times, it updates every 30 seconds with new bombs or new, you know, political mud-slinging, all that stuff I got to kind of check into. And so, it gets to the point where I can’t even just let my, let it all down and just be. And that takes a toll on our mental health.\n \n\n**Macie Jepson** \n  \n\n I want us to talk a little, little bit more about technology and social media in a couple of minutes, but let’s talk about the benefits of actually shutting down our brain, the benefits of boredom.\n \n\n**Dr. Patrick Runnels** \n  \n\n Couple of things to know. When we are, you know, our brains are naturally, there’s thoughts in there, and those thoughts are, it’s natural for brain to have kind of thoughts, pinging, making connections every time we have a stimulus coming in. So, I look at the floor and I see that it’s wood, or I look at the wall and see that it’s white or I see that a person’s coming in. All those stimuli trigger thoughts, and our brains are looking and like to be occupied with things. So, our brains have ways of working. Every human is a little different, but any, as we kind of move through the day, our brains are kind of naturally seeking things to pay attention to. That’s kind of how we evolved. And so, we’re naturally attracted to things that are of interest to us.\n \n\n We like seeing movies or playing video games or reading books that are of topics we like. We like hanging out with certain people more than other people, because they’re compelling to us. They trigger certain kind of emotional thoughts in us. They, you know, our emotions in us, they trigger certain thoughts. And so, in that regard, our brains are looking for stimulus that makes us happy, and that connects with us, and that’s actually, to some degree, somewhat relaxing for us. Someone can be really interested in a topic and look really turned like, turned on, like activated and kind of seem like they’re not relaxed, but be in a state of relative calm because it’s stimulating the brain in a certain way. Take that away, get to a place where you don’t have things that are really be stimulating for you. That is a world that, we kind of call that boredom. And to some degree, if we’re sitting too long without something that’s very stimulating for us, boredom is really the feeling, the discomfort because your attention isn’t being captured in a certain way.\n \n\n So, no matter where I am, I’m still getting stimuli. I’m still being able to see this is a floor that’s wood, and I’m able to see a wall that’s white, but if it’s not capturing my attention in a certain way then I feel uncomfortable. I don’t like it. It’s an unpleasant thing, so boredom serves a purpose. Boredom serves the purpose of having us go seek things out. It also serves the purpose of allowing our brain to start to make new connections. So, if I’m not being fed things all the time that are stimulating to me, well, then my brain’s got to come up with new things to kind of make connections that get us back to that state. That ability to do that is actually where we have a lot of innovation happen, and it’s where a lot of our creativity happens. So, creativity is very heavily correlated with downtime, time when you’re not being over stimulated. In a connected world, when you don’t set that time aside, you lose the opportunity to make creative connections. You lose the opportunity to see things and connect things in a new way. And when that happens, when you miss that all the time, this other thing happens, which is that you start to feel a little bit…despair is the wrong word…but you start to feel a certain sense of unease. It’s not boredom. So, I’m still being stimulated. So, imagine someone who’s checking Facebook all the time and playing video games all the time and constantly checking the news. There’s things going on. They’re usually checking things that are of interest to them, but there starts to be a certain emptiness to it, a certain blaséness\n *(sic)* \n"",""title"":"""",""url"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""filepath"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""chunk_id"":""0""}]}","5","

With virtual visits, you can access many of the same services you typically receive during a traditional in-person appointment, including remote symptom monitoring, diagnosis and treatment, prescriptions, and other medical services.\n \n\n Most doctors will tell you that simply talking with their patients is one of the most important parts of their assessment. Asking patients about current symptoms, personal and family history, environment at work and home, and lifestyle habits can provide physicians with important information that can help them reach a diagnosis and develop a plan of care. As we all know, a written record of a conversation misses many small details that a live conversation picks up. Tone of voice, hesitation before answering, general appearance of fatigue or of being well-rested can all be valuable clues to health that can be picked up visually.

This technology allows a group of individuals, such as patients, their family and clinical team members, to video chat together from multiple locations. Patients in isolation are provided with a UH iPad for this purpose, and the calls are secure and compliant with HIPAA.\n \n\n This multi-person video conferencing has already proven useful because inpatient care teams can safely interact with a patient in isolation and collaborate with each other on the patient’s plan of care. This can be used by caregivers so they do not need to enter a patient room, decreasing exposure risk, while at the same time offering their expertise. This technology enables clinical teams to remotely monitor patients at other UH facilities. Likewise, experts can visit several patients in several different locations without traveling.\n \n\n*Steven Baldridge, RN, is a staff educator at University Hospitals Samaritan Medical Center.* \n\n\thttps://www.uhhospitals.org/blog/articles/2020/07/curious-about-virtual-visits-heres-what-to-ex"",""title"":"""",""url"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""filepath"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""chunk_id"":""0""},{""content"":""Title: uh_blogs.csv lot of people don’t understand, it’s, you brought up a sore throat or an earache, it’s okay to go to your healthcare system’s website that allows entry into the on-demand virtual spaces, if you’re not sure, and usually they’ll guide you.

But if you’re part of an ongoing, regular continuity relationship with a provider, whether they be in the primary care space or a specialty space, and you see them regularly, I think having that conversation, when can we do this virtually versus when can we do this in person, is a really reasonable and now normal conversation. And providers in their own specialties will have no problem saying, when we need to get a weight, when we need to do lab work associated with your visit or other testing, we’ll have you come in. But in the in-betweens, we can do it virtually.\n \n\n**Pete Kenworthy** \n  \n\n And there are things that people may not be thinking about, right? You can have that continuum of care for chronic problems. You can have it for prescriptions that may be needed to be refilled, things like that.\n \n\n**Brian Zack, MD** \n  \n\n Correct. Anything I can prescribe in the office at current state, I can prescribe virtually. There are some limitations and they probably are going to get a little tighter on controlled substances, but that makes sense for safety. But in other realms, in terms of any blood pressure, cholesterol, antidepressants, antibiotics, if clinically appropriate, can all be prescribed virtually.\n \n\n**Macie Jepson** \n  \n\n What stands out to me in what you just said, continuum of care. Important to note, this isn’t meant to be a replacement for your physician.\n \n\n**Brian Zack, MD** \n  \n\n So this is about your physician. This is about your ability to navigate your health, your personal journey, and how health systems can be a partner and offer you resources. And virtual care is one of those resources. Some data that came out during the pandemic, just to make an example, is when you go see a primary care doctor or a specialty physician for a scheduled clinic visit, and we assume the normal average time of transportation, parking, walking in the building, checking in, waiting for the doctor or a provider, seeing them, checking out and reverse, going home compared to a virtual visit starting at home, the average virtual visit without significant delay was between 22 and 26 minutes. The average time door to door for an in-person visit was over three hours. This is why people take half days off of work for a doctor’s appointment, or they could take their break, go in a private room and do it from work or home. So the ability to access those services is actually reinforcing that continuum of care and not creating barriers.\n \n\n**Pete Kenworthy** \n  \n\n Let’s tie a bow on this. Anything else? Anything we left out or just kind of a takeaway for people here.\n \n\n**Brian Zack, MD** \n  \n\n As I think that we’ve said over and over about the value of virtual care in not being its unique, one-time visit, but about the bigger picture and your total health. As patients become more comfortable and more engaged in these options, we actually have changed, and we’re using a term called digital health, which actually means we’re looking at ways technology can be part of this journey beyond the video camera on your computer. We are using text chats to help people follow chronic conditions. We’re allowing patients to use email or e-visits to ask very simple non-complicated questions that don’t require the video. We’re looking at other technology like remote patient monitoring. So if you wear a blood pressure cuff at home or a continuous glucose monitor for diabetes, all of these equipment are now being tied digitally into our electronic medical records as part of your total picture. And we’re making sure that along with virtual visits, all this technology together is allowing our patients to stay healthy at home as opposed to sick at the hospital.\n \n\n**Pete Kenworthy** \n  \n\n Dr. Brian Zack, Medical Director for Telehealth at University Hospitals in Cleveland, thanks so much for being with us today.\n \n\n**Brian Zack, MD** \n  \n\n Thank you so much for having me.\n \n\n\thttps://www.uhhospitals.org"",""title"":"""",""url"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""filepath"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""chunk_id"":""0""},{""content"":""Title: uh_blogs.csv insurance coverage prior to the pandemic, the only insurances that paid prior to the pandemic on a regular basis was Medicare for rural patients, and they had to be very strict criteria to make it eligible, so much so that most providers didn’t even understand those rules and therefore didn’t participate. But as the pandemic hit and in the first months of the pandemic, over 70% of our visits in this system were performed virtually for a few months. That includes primary care, specialty care and urgent care. So most patients were being seen virtually while we figured out what was safe and what was unsafe as the healthcare system, the Federal Government, led by making these reimbursable. And while we don’t want to always associate money with our health, it was that paradigm shift that allowed healthcare systems and physicians to embrace this technology as a safe part of their practice.\n \n\n And now it is a part of our permanent model. The most important thing to address is that it’s not just for people who can’t get in. It’s an access initiative to allow people to not have to leave work, not have to leave school, whose physician might be across town if it’s a specialist and they want to see them from their home. The most important thing here is, and this is something I try to say over and over again the more I talk about telehealth and virtual care, is we should not both as patients, but also as providers and healthcare professionals, we should not be thinking of telehealth or virtual care as a binary choice between in-person visits and virtual visits. You’re not making a choice, one or the other. It’s a new tool. Don’t think of it as the visit. Think of it as a stethoscope or as an otoscope we use to look at your ears.\n \n\n It’s a tool that your providers can use to manage your personal healthcare needs. And so what I mean by that is it’s great for triage. Do I need to go, to your question earlier, about when do I go to the ER versus urgent care versus my primary care doctor’s office versus a virtual visit? The answer is it could be used to triage and help you make that decision before you commit to all night in the emergency room. It can be used to follow up on a visit that you may have not otherwise done. And we’ve actually shown some evidence and we being healthcare system that people who do a follow-up visit virtually after leaving the hospital or emergency room because they couldn’t get in with their specialist or primary care doctor are less likely to be readmitted because we’ve addressed any in-between needs that occurred since their discharge. So it is a new part of the healthcare system. It’s not an either/or.\n \n\n**Pete Kenworthy** \n  \n\n Yeah. That was the next myth on our list here is that virtual care is only for urgent care.\n \n\n**Brian Zack, MD** \n  \n\n Absolutely not. And I think, though, the biggest impact that virtual care has had now and will continue to have in the future is that it is now being used to manage chronic care, to manage how patients flow through the system. One great example will be a patient who was admitted to the hospital for congestive heart failure, one of our most common reasons for admission. When they’re discharged, they’re told to follow up with their primary care doctor and their cardiologist. When we get them in with a member of that care team within three to seven days for a virtual check-in, there are certain questions for congestive heart failure that they ask, like, has your weight gone up? Are you having difficulty with movement or going up and downstairs that would indicate you’re getting worse again? These virtual quick touch-bases that don’t involve an all day trip to the doctor are preventing people from having to be readmitted, are helping care teams pivot and readjust a treatment plan prior to their need to be seen in the office. So it’s a part of that journey.\n \n\n**Pete Kenworthy** \n  \n\n So you’re actually differentiating between two different things here. There’s scheduled virtual care where you make a scheduled appointment with your doctor, and then there’s on demand virtual care where, oh my gosh, my throat hurts, or I see this rash on me. Those are two different things, but it’s the same vehicle that gets those answers.\n \n\n**Brian Zack, MD** \n  \n\n I’m so glad you asked. That’s a really phenomenal question. So yes. Actually, the majority of virtual visits, and not by a little bit, the vast majority of virtual visits that are our system, and I would venture to say most systems are currently seeing, are in the scheduled category. Any physician who has a clinic, an outpatient clinic, can see patients either in person as we’re all used to the traditional visit or can do a virtual visit. And here at UH, an example, every single department does virtual visits, some more than others, but every"",""title"":"""",""url"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""filepath"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""chunk_id"":""0""},{""content"":""Title: uh_blogs.csv visits are appropriate for many conditions, including colds, flu, allergies, skin conditions, diarrhea, vomiting, sinus pain, sore throat and urinary tract infections.\n \n\n### See a UH provider and get the medical care you need, when you need it\n\n Available 7 days a week, 7 a.m. – 11 p.m. EST Learn More Other times, it’s a starting point to getting the care you need, says Brian Zack, MD , medical director for University Hospitals Telehealth.

PCOS causes the reproductive hormones to be out of balance, which can lead to the ovaries becoming enlarged and developing many small cysts.\n \n\n Symptoms of PCOS include irregular or missed periods, hirsutism (excess hair growth on the face and body), acne, glucose intolerance, weight gain or obesity, and elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Many women with PCOS also struggle with infertility. Additionally, the chronic lack of menstruation puts women with PCOS at a higher risk for uterine cancer.\n \n\n While PCOS cannot be cured, there are many options available to manage the symptoms, including options to improve fertility, says University Hospitals OB/GYN physician Diana Carmona, MD . These can include medications as well as lifestyle changes such as diet, exercise and weight loss.\n \n\nDiagnosing PCOS\n---------------\n\n Physicians use a set of criteria to diagnose PCOS. Your doctor will discuss your symptoms with you and may diagnose you with PCOS if you meet two of the following three criteria:\n \n\n* Hormone imbalance: a blood test will measure your hormones to see if you have elevated androgen levels\n* Infrequent periods (oligomenorrhea): This is defined as less than nine menstrual cycles a year\n* Polycystic ovaries: This can be determined through an ultrasound\n\nTreatment Options\n-----------------\n\n**Medications.** \n Doctors often prescribe hormonal birth control pills or an intrauterine device (IUD) to help regulate periods and manage the symptoms of PCOS.

You don’t need to travel to another location, and there is minimal wait time.\n* **Urgent care** \n – Urgent care offices are open daily with evening, weekend and holiday hours. Like a doctor’s office, urgent cares are also able to treat illnesses and minor injuries, such as dislocations, sprains and fractures.\n* **Emergency room (ER)** \n – For severe health and life-threatening issues such as heart attack, stroke or overdose, the ER is the best option. The average wait time in the ER can sometimes be three or more hours.\n\nHealth Care Through Your Smart Phone\n------------------------------------\n\n Recently, University Hospitals opened a telehealth service called UH Virtual Visit to patients and people seeking treatment for many non-emergency medical conditions. UH Virtual Visit offers a way to get virtual medical, health and education services through a smartphone or secure video.\n \n\n “With UH Virtual Visit, the biggest advantage is the convenience,” Dr. Kissinger says. “The same quality is there, it’s just a different setting. Also, telehealth services are ideal for treating low-acuity conditions that don’t need any physical intervention – like a laceration would.”\n \n\n If you’ve ever gone to your doctor to be treated for conditions such as poison ivy, flu symptoms or urinary tract infections (UTIs), UH Virtual Visit can save you time.\n \n\n “A lot of people, especially women, know when they have a UTI,” Dr. Kissinger says. “They know the symptoms.

"3","Can you tell me about parenting during pregnancy?","Parenting during pregnancy involves preparing for the arrival of a new child while navigating the physical and emotional changes that come with pregnancy. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Involvement of Partners**: Fathers play a crucial role during pregnancy and beyond. Their active involvement can significantly improve the child's well-being, leading to better physical and mental health outcomes for the child [doc5]. Engaging in activities like talking to the unborn baby, attending prenatal visits, and providing emotional support to the mother can strengthen the bond with the baby [doc5].

2. **Emotional Adjustments**: The transition into parenthood can be overwhelming. Expecting parents should communicate openly about their feelings and concerns. It's important to support each other emotionally during this time, as both partners may experience stress and anxiety [doc5].

3. **Physical Health**: Maintaining a healthy lifestyle during pregnancy is essential. This includes proper nutrition, regular exercise (as advised by a healthcare provider), and avoiding harmful substances . Expecting parents should also be aware of the importance of prenatal care to monitor the health of both the mother and the baby .

4. **Preparing for the Baby**: Parents often spend time preparing for the baby's arrival by setting up a nursery, purchasing baby gear, and attending parenting classes. This preparation can help ease the transition into parenthood [doc3].

5. **Postpartum Considerations**: The period after childbirth, often referred to as the ""fourth trimester,"" is also a significant time for both parents. It's essential to recognize that the emotional and physical adjustments continue even after the baby is born [doc3]. Parents should be aware of signs of postpartum depression and seek help if needed [doc3].

Overall, parenting during pregnancy is about building a supportive environment for both the mother and the baby, ensuring that both physical and emotional needs are met.","{""citations"":[{""content"":""Title: uh_blogs.csv observations during pregnancy. These may include whether you are carrying the baby low or high, if you are craving sweet versus salty foods, or how fast the baby’s heart rate is.\n \n\n But none of these have any basis in science and they are not reliable predictors of sex or gender, says Hetrick.\n \n\n The only sure way to predict the sex of your baby is through ultrasound or certain blood tests. An ultrasound can determine sex around 19–20 weeks, and blood tests such as non-invasive prenatal testing can determine the sex of a baby beginning around 10 weeks.\n \n\n Hetrick says you should look at gender predictions as a fun way for loved ones to stay connected with your pregnancy. People are just excited about the new baby and looking for ways to stay involved.\n \n\nMyth \\#2: You shouldn’t exercise during pregnancy.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n Exercise is a healthy part of pregnancy for most women. Hetrick says the most important advice is to listen to your body. You should be able to maintain your pre-pregnancy exercise routines, but don’t start any unusual or strenuous exercise if your body is not used to it, and always check with your provider to make sure you are exercising safely.\n \n\nMyth \\#3: You shouldn’t have sex during pregnancy.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n As long as your medical provider doesn't recommend any restrictions, Hetrick says it is perfectly safe to have sex while pregnant.\n \n\n “Sex is a healthy part of pregnancy, if that's what makes you happy,” Hetrick says.\n \n\n Sex with a male partner can also be beneficial because sperm contains the hormone prostaglandin, which helps the cervix soften to stimulate labor. As long as your water isn’t broken or your provider hasn’t told you that it is unsafe to have sex, you can safely have sex right up until the end of your pregnancy.\n \n\nMyth \\#4. You shouldn’t dye or color your hair while pregnant.\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Hetrick says it’s fine to color your hair during pregnancy, though she recommends waiting until after the first trimester to be completely safe.\n \n\nMyth \\#5: You should avoid hot tubs during pregnancy.\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n There is some truth to this one. If the temperature of a bath or hot tub is over 101 degrees Fahrenheit, you should avoid it. Hetrick says some studies show an increased risk of neural tube defects in babies whose mothers submerged themselves in water over 101 degrees. As long as the temperature is cool enough and you make sure you are staying hydrated, you can continue to take warm baths or enjoy soaking.\n \n\nMyth \\#6: It’s unsafe to reach your arms over your head when pregnant.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n This myth claims that if you reach your arms over your head, the umbilical cord could get wrapped around the baby’s neck. Hetrick says that while it’s true that the cord can get wrapped around the baby’s neck, especially after 20 weeks when the baby starts getting very active, it rarely causes any harm to the baby.\n \n\n “The reassuring thing is that four out of every 10 babies are born with the cord wrapped around their neck, and it usually doesn't pose any problems,” Hetrick says.\n \n\nMyth \\#7: You are eating for two.\n---------------------------------\n\n As much as many pregnant women would like to believe that they are “eating for two” – this is not a good goal for a healthy pregnancy diet.\n \n\n “You should not have the mentality of eating for two, because we know from literature and research that too much weight gain can affect pregnancy and increase the risk of a C-section, diabetes and hypertension,” says Hetrick.\n \n\n While eating for two does not mean eating twice as much food, you do need to increase your caloric intake during pregnancy. Experts usually recommend eating about 300 calories extra every day.\n \n\nMyth \\#8: You should cut out all caffeine when pregnant.\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n Caffeine does not need to be cut out completely. The recommended upper limit of caffeine is about 220 milligrams a day. This is the amount in about one to two cups of coffee. But remember, there is caffeine in other things as well, including soda, black tea and chocolate.\n \n\nMyth \\#9: You shouldn’t eat seafood, soft cheese, deli meat or rare steak.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n Hetrick says fish such as tilefish, swordfish and mackerel should be avoided due to the high concentration of mercury, but other fish are fine in moderation. Some fish such as salmon, sardines and anchovies are especially good choices because they are both low in mercury and high in omega-3 fatty acids.\n \n\n As far as sushi goes, as long as it is from a reputable source, it’s probably ok to eat occasionally.\n \n\n Hetrick says that soft cheeses such as brie, chevre and blue cheese should be avoided during pregnancy unless they are heated first.

It all leads up to the wonderful moment when your newborn is placed in your arms for the first time. But what often gets overlooked is that this is just the beginning of a huge period of growth and transition, for both parent and baby.\n \n\n The newborn postpartum phase is sometimes referred to as the fourth trimester. While we typically think of a pregnancy in terms of first, second and third trimesters, the period from birth to 12 weeks is a continuation of everything that pregnancy has led up to, explains University Hospitals certified nurse-midwife and mother of two, Lisa Vagi, CNM .\n \n\n “We’re getting away from the idea that the journey of pregnancy ends at birth. There’s still a significant period of transition after the baby is born,” says Vagi.\n \n\n During this period, your body is healing from childbirth and going through changes as your hormones adjust. You are also navigating your new role as a parent, or adjusting to adding another child to the family. You may be establishing breastfeeding (if you choose to breastfeed) and are trying to bond with and take care of your newborn, all while dealing with the lack of sleep that comes with a new baby.\n \n\nAn Emotional Roller Coaster\n---------------------------\n\n All of these changes can be overwhelming, and you may not be prepared for how it’s going to feel if you have never been through it before. In the first couple weeks after delivery, the emotional ups and downs are often referred to as the “baby blues”. This is very common, affecting about 80 percent of new moms. But this initial wave of emotions – fueled by big hormonal shifts – usually goes away on its own after about two weeks.\n \n\n If these feelings last beyond two or three weeks, it could be a sign of postpartum depression (PPD) – which affects up to 20 percent of women. Symptoms include mood swings, sadness and crying, anxiety, inability to concentrate, poor appetite and sleep problems. Other postpartum behavioral health disorders include postpartum anxiety , postpartum post-traumatic stress disorder and postpartum psychosis, which is a rare but serious disorder.\n \n\n Vagi says symptoms of PPD or other mental health problems should not be ignored and you should talk to your provider if you or your partner notice any concerning behaviors. Seeking help is important because there are many very effective treatment options available to treat maternal mental health symptoms.\n \n\nFourth Trimester Affects the Whole Family\n-----------------------------------------\n\n While this postpartum period often focuses on the birthing person and baby, the fourth trimester really affects the whole family, including partners and other children. There are multiple ways your partner can support you during your recovery. These include:\n \n\n* Handling overnight feedings (if bottle feeding) or diaper duty\n* Taking care of other children while you feed or hold your newborn\n* Taking over household duties such as cooking so you can rest\n\n It is also important to involve older siblings in the routines you establish. Vagi suggests giving them an age-appropriate job or task to help them feel involved and get them excited about the new baby. You can also try to include some one-on-one time with older siblings every day to make them feel special.\n \n\n Vagi advises talking about these things early in the pregnancy. Have conversations with your partner or family about ways they can"",""title"":"""",""url"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""filepath"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""chunk_id"":""0""},{""content"":""Title: uh_blogs.csv This allows parents to prepare for the birth of a child with special needs. It also helps other specialists, such as pediatric surgeons and neonatologists, develop a plan to treat the baby after, and sometimes before, birth.\n \n\n “After confirming a fetal diagnosis, it is critical to assemble the right care team for the baby’s unique needs,” Dr. Ragsdale says. “As one of a few facilities in the country with complete obstetric, delivery, newborn, pediatric and adult services and specialists all in one place, our patients truly benefit from the vast expertise we can provide.”\n \n\n**Checking the health of multiples:** \n Twins, triplets and other multiples face a variety of risks and higher odds for early delivery. Maternal-fetal medicine specialists can track their growth and use advanced imaging techniques to look for causes of medical issues they may face, such as slow growth or circulation problems. In some cases, they can even perform procedures to correct issues before birth.\n \n\n**Assessing other problems and risks:** \n Maternal-fetal medicine specialists care for women with pre-existing health problems and conditions that arise during pregnancy, such as diabetes and high blood pressure.\n \n\n “We provide expert advice and care throughout pregnancy to women with high-risk medical issues to minimize risk for complications, such as preterm birth,” Dr. Ragsdale says.\n \n\nLabor and Delivery\n------------------\n\n Depending on the complication or diagnosis, medical or surgical treatment may be required during or immediately after delivery. “If so, it is critical to deliver at a facility equipped to provide the highest level of care to both mom and baby,” Dr. Ragsdale says.\n \n\nPostpartum\n----------\n\n Women who have complications after birth, such as heavy bleeding or infections, may receive care from an MFM along with an intensive care team.\n \n\n### Related links\n\n UH offers online scheduling for select UH physicians and specialties, including OB-GYN services .

Among them:\n \n\n* Sharing a bed with an adult\n* Sleeping on an adult mattress\n* Being put to sleep on their sides\n* Being placed on soft bedding\n* Being overdressed for the temperature\n* Having their faces covered\n* Being exposed to cigarette smoke\n\n The study found that infants with one or more of each type of risk factor were at higher risk.\n \n\n Taking these precautions also can help keep your baby safe:\n \n\n* Remove all soft toys, pillows, blankets and bumper pads from the crib.\n* Breastfeed your baby.\n* Give your baby a pacifier.\n* Let your child’s doctor know if your baby ever goes limp, turns blue or appears to stop breathing for any period of time.\n\n\thttps://www.uhhospitals.org/blog/articles/2018/01/new-advice-on-preventing-sids-and-other-sleep-related-infant-deaths\n\tGrade School Bullying Can Lead to High School Substance Abuse\tJanuary 01, 2018\t[{'label': 'Under The Rainbow - Winter 2018', 'url': '/blog/tags/under-the-rainbow-winter-2018'}, {'label': 'Back to School', 'url': '/blog/tags/back-to-school'}, {'label': 'Child Safety', 'url': '/blog/tags/child-safety'}, {'label': \""Children's Health\"", 'url': '/blog/tags/childrens-health'}, {'label': 'Parenting', 'url': '/blog/tags/parenting'}]\tNo related links found\t[{'label': 'Kimberly Burkhart, PhD', 'url':"",""title"":"""",""url"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""filepath"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""chunk_id"":""0""},{""content"":""Title: uh_blogs.csv child will need follow-up care throughout life to look for any recurrent or new cancer, as well as side effects or complications from treatment. “It’s important to find a provider who is trained in the late effects of childhood cancer to maintain long-term health,” says Dr. Hackney. “The follow up is different for each patient and depends on the type of cancer and treatment, overall health status, genetic factors and other health habits.”\n \n\n**Keep careful medical records.** \n Be sure to note details of the diagnosis, treatments, side effects and any complications.

Teach the importance of avoiding smoking, eating a balanced and nutritious diet, and getting plenty of regular exercise.\n \n\n**Keep your child emotionally fit.** \n You know the emotional toll your child’s illness took on you and your child. Nurture emotional well-being by encouraging your child to talk about their feelings. See whether your child is comfortable speaking with a counselor to deal with depression, stress, anxiety or fear of the illness returning.

But fathers play a vital role, too. They can contribute much more than just another set of hands to change a diaper.\n \n\n “When fathers are actively involved during and after pregnancy, it can significantly improve the child’s wellbeing,” says Lisa Vagi, CNM , a certified midwife at University Hospitals “For example, babies with involved dads have greater physical and mental health. Throughout life, they tend to be more social, have higher self-esteem, do better in school and have fewer behavioral problems.”\n \n\n Dads, here’s how you can give your baby the best start.\n \n\nConnect Early\n-------------\n\n All dads can forge a powerful bond with their little ones. The key is to connect from the beginning:\n \n\n* Talk to your unborn baby. Sing, tell jokes or read stories. Your infant will recognize your voice from the moment of birth.\n* Hold your baby skin-to-skin as much as possible. Cuddle them to your chest so they can hear your heartbeat.\n* Participate in one-on-one time by giving baby a bath or feeding with a bottle, if possible. Not only does it give mom a break, but it can also help you grow closer.\n\nFocus on Quality Time\n---------------------\n\n Concerned that work takes you away from your child? What happens if you don’t live in the same household? Not to worry. “When it comes to time, quality is more important than quantity,” says Vagi. To make the most of moments together:\n \n\n* Put away your phone and give full attention to your baby.\n* Become an expert on your infant. What makes them laugh? Do they have a favorite song you can sing?\n* As your baby grows, create a special daily ritual with them, such as reading a bedtime story every night. (Video calls work, too!)\n\nOffer Support\n-------------\n\n Dads can also be a strong emotional support to moms:\n \n\n* Attend prenatal and postnatal visits with your partner.\n* Take walks together. It can give you time to connect.\n* Keep tabs on your partner’s emotional well-being, as well as your own. Welcoming a new member to the family is a major transition. Having someone to talk to and finding a support group can help.\n\n\thttps://www.uhhospitals.org/blog/articles/2024/02/dads-play-an-important-role-in-pregnancy-and-beyond\n\tTelemedicine: Convenient and Immediate Access ("",""title"":"""",""url"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""filepath"":""uh_blogs.csv"",""chunk_id"":""0""}]}","5","
